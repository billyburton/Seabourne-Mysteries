<h1>The Christmas Tree Conspiracy</h1>
<p>by Will Kershaw</p>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Daniel Turner loved the workshop. He loved the rich, warm aroma of the different species of wood - oak, sapele, walnut - each having their own character. He enjoyed selecting the perfect wood blank, running his hand over them, feeling for little imperfects that might add character, or destroy a piece.</p>
<p>Daniel Turner selected a smooth, walnut blank, its rich, dark grain catching the light in the workshop. He carried it over to his lathe, the heavy wood gripped firmly in his hands. With practiced movements, he secured the blank onto the lathe, tightening the chuck until secure.</p>
<p>Stepping back, Daniel ran his fingers over the wood, tracing the grain and checking for any imperfections. Satisfied, he moved to the controls, powering on the machine. The walnut blank began to spin, slowly at first, then picking up speed. Soon it became a smooth, whirling blur.</p>
<p>Gripping the tool rest, Daniel pressed a gouge against the spinning wood, the sharp edge biting into the surface. Shavings flew as he guided the tool, shaping the blank into the beginnings of a bowl. His brow furrowed in concentration, all of his focus narrowed down to the dance of the wood and the tool.</p>
<p>Daniel continued guiding the gouge across the spinning walnut, the wood shaping into a graceful curve under his skilled hands. Shavings flew as he worked, the rhythmic sound of the lathe soothing his focus.</p>
<p>With a gentle touch, Daniel slowed the lathe, allowing the bowl to come to a stop. He ran his fingers along the smooth, sculpted surface, inspecting his work. The shape form beautifully, the wood&#39;s rich grain accentuated by the curves.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his eyes narrowed as he noticed a tiny, almost imperceptible blemish near the rim of the bowl. Nothing but a small imperfection, easily overlooked by most, but to Daniel it stood out like a sore thumb. His fingers traced the spot, feeling the slight irregularity in the otherwise flawless surface.</p>
<p>This tiny flaw, like a hidden clue, sparked Daniel&#39;s interest. He knew from experience that such insignificant details could often hold the key to unraveling a much larger mystery. Nodding to himself, he carefully removed the unfinished bowl from the lathe and set it aside, already mentally cataloging the imperfection for future reference.</p>
<p>Turning his attention to the shelves of wood blanks, Daniel selected a new piece, this one a lighter maple. As he carried it back to the lathe, his mind was already racing, anticipating the next step in his creative process.</p>
<hr>
<p>The rhythmic hum of the lathe filled the workshop as Daniel worked, his focus entirely on the piece of maple spinning before him. He didn&#39;t hear the creak of the door opening over the sound of his work.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding stepped into the workshop, her sturdy shoes tapping against the wooden floor. She paused for a moment, watching Daniel as he shaped the wood with practiced precision. A small smile tugged at her lips, seeing the young man so engrossed in his craft.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel?&quot; she called out, raising her voice to be heard over the machinery.</p>
<p>Daniel blinked, momentarily startled by the unexpected voice. He turned off the lathe and set his tools down carefully before turning to face Mrs. Harding. His eyes met hers briefly before darting away, focusing on a point just over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Mrs. Harding,&quot; he said, his voice steady but lacking the usual inflections most people used in conversation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding&#39;s eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled warmly at him. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything too important, Daniel. I wanted to have a quick word with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed slightly as he processed her words. He glanced back at his unfinished project, then to Mrs. Harding again. &quot;I was working on a new bowl,&quot; he explained, gesturing towards the lathe. &quot;But I can take a break. What did you want to talk about?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding took a few steps closer, her keen eyes taking in the scattered wood shavings and the neat array of tools on Daniel&#39;s workbench. &quot;Well, I wanted to remind you about the Christmas tree lighting ceremony tonight. You&#39;ll be attending with Chloe, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his fingers fidgeting with a small piece of sandpaper he&#39;d picked up from his workbench. The thought of the crowded ceremony made his stomach churn.</p>
<p>&quot;I... I don&#39;t know if I want to go,&quot; he said, his voice barely above a whisper. He kept his eyes fixed on the sandpaper, tracing its rough texture with his fingertips. &quot;There&#39;ll too many people, too much noise. It&#39;s... overwhelming.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding&#39;s expression softened. She&#39;d known Daniel long enough to understand his discomfort with large social gatherings. &quot;I know it can be difficult for you, Daniel,&quot; she said gently. &quot;But it&#39;s an important event for the town. And remember, Chloe will be there with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s shoulders tensed at the mention of the ceremony again. He shook his head slightly, still not meeting Mrs. Harding&#39;s gaze. &quot;Even with Chloe... it&#39;s too much. The lights, the chatter, everyone bumping into each other. I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t process it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding took a step closer, careful not to invade Daniel&#39;s personal space. &quot;I understand, Daniel. But think about it this way: it&#39;s a chance to observe the town in a different setting. You might notice things others don&#39;t, just like you do with your woodworking.&quot;</p>
<p>This caught Daniel&#39;s attention. He glanced up briefly, his eyes meeting Mrs. Harding&#39;s for a fleeting moment before darting away again. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked, curiosity evident in his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Mrs. Harding continued, encouraged by his interest, &quot;you have a unique way of seeing the world, Daniel. Your attention to detail could make the ceremony more interesting than you think. And who knows? You might even enjoy watching how everyone interacts.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel considered her words, his fingers still absently working the sandpaper. The idea of observing rather than participating eased some of his anxiety. &quot;I... I suppose I could try,&quot; he said hesitantly. &quot;If Chloe&#39;s there, and if I can find a quiet spot to watch from...&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding smiled warmly. &quot;That&#39;s the spirit, Daniel. And remember, you can always leave if it becomes too much. No one will think any less of you for it.&quot;</p>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Daniel sat on the edge of his bed, his fingers tracing the familiar patterns of his quilt. The thought of the Christmas lights ceremony loomed over him like a dark cloud, making his stomach churn with anxiety. He glanced at the clock on his bedside table, The consistent ticking served as a constant reminder that time was steadily passing by., bringing him closer to the dreaded event.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, trying to calm his racing thoughts, but memories of his last encounter with a large crowd flooded back. It had been at the Seabourne Summer Festival, just a few months ago. The cacophony of voices, the press of bodies, the overwhelming assault on his senses - it all came rushing back with vivid clarity.</p>
<p>Daniel remembered how he&#39;d frozen in place, unable to move or speak as people jostled around him. The noise had become a deafening roar, drowning out any semblance of coherent thought. He&#39;d felt his breath coming in short, sharp gasps, his vision narrowing to a pinpoint.</p>
<p>If it hadn&#39;t been for Chloe, gently guiding him away from the crowd and finding a quiet spot behind the food stalls, he might have completely shut down. She had sat with him, her calm presence anchoring him as he slowly regained his composure.</p>
<p>Now, as he contemplated the Christmas lights ceremony, that same feeling of panic began to creep in. He could already imagine the crush of people, the excited chatter, the flashing lights. His hands began to tremble slightly at the thought.</p>
<p>Daniel stood up abruptly, pacing the small confines of his room. He paused at the window, looking out at the quiet street below. The town seemed peaceful now, but soon it would be transformed into a bustling hub of activity. He pressed his forehead against the cool glass, trying to steady himself.</p>
<hr>
<p>A soft knock at the door interrupted Daniel&#39;s anxious reverie. He turned, recognizing the familiar pattern - three quick taps followed by two slower ones. Chloe&#39;s knock.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in,&quot; he called, his voice slightly strained.</p>
<p>Chloe entered the room, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. Her warm brown eyes immediately took in Daniel&#39;s tense posture and the way his fingers fidgeted with the hem of his shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; she said softly, closing the door behind her. &quot;Mrs. Harding let me in. You okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, unable to find the right words to express the tumult of emotions churning inside him. Chloe stepped closer, her movements slow and deliberate, careful not to startle him.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceremony?&quot; she asked, understanding dawning on her face.</p>
<p>He nodded, grateful for her perceptiveness. Chloe gently guided him to sit on the edge of the bed, taking a seat beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s okay to be nervous, Daniel,&quot; she said, her voice soothing. &quot;But remember, you&#39;ve got this. We&#39;ve got this.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel took a deep breath, focusing on Chloe&#39;s calm presence beside him. She waited patiently, giving him time to gather his thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;ll be so many people,&quot; he finally managed to say, his voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, acknowledging his fear. &quot;You&#39;re right, there will be. But we don&#39;t have to be in the middle of it all. We can find a quiet spot, away from the crowd. Somewhere you can see everything without feeling overwhelmed.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked at her, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. &quot;You&#39;ll stay with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Chloe assured him, her smile warm and genuine. &quot;I won&#39;t leave your side, I promise. We&#39;re in this together, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>She gently placed her hand on his arm, a grounding touch that helped calm his racing thoughts. &quot;We can go early, find the perfect spot before everyone else arrives. And if it gets too much, we can leave anytime. No pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel felt the knot in his chest begin to loosen. Chloe&#39;s words and presence were like a balm to his frayed nerves. He nodded slowly, feeling more confident with each passing moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; he said, his voice stronger now. &quot;Let&#39;s go to the ceremony.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel stepped out of the house, the crisp winter air nipping at their cheeks. The sky was a canvas of deep blues and purples, the last vestiges of daylight fading as they set off towards The Market Square. Daniel&#39;s shoulders tense, his eyes darting around nervously, but Chloe&#39;s presence beside him was a steady anchor.</p>
<p>As they walked, Chloe nudged Daniel gently with her elbow. &quot;Hey, did you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel glanced at her, curiosity momentarily overriding his anxiety. &quot;No, what about them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He just needed a little space,&quot; Chloe delivered with a grin.</p>
<p>A surprised chuckle escaped Daniel&#39;s lips, his posture relaxing slightly. Encouraged, Chloe continued, &quot;And what do you call a fake noodle?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel thought for a moment, then shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;An impasta!&quot; Chloe exclaimed, her eyes twinkling with mirth.</p>
<p>This time, Daniel laughed louder, more genuine. He felt the knot in his chest loosening with each step, Chloe&#39;s lighthearted banter creating a bubble of comfort around them.</p>
<p>As they rounded a corner, the distant sound of the gathering crowd reached their ears. Daniel tensed again, but Chloe was ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, your turn,&quot; she challenged. &quot;Tell me a joke about wood. I know you&#39;ve got a million of them stored away in that brilliant brain of yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed in concentration, momentarily distracted from his rising anxiety. &quot;Well,&quot; he began hesitantly, &quot;Why don&#39;t trees ever go to the beach?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow, intrigued. &quot;I don&#39;t know, why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because they&#39;re afraid to get their trunks wet,&quot; Daniel finished, a small smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>Chloe burst into laughter, the sound warm and genuine. &quot;That&#39;s terrible,&quot; she said between giggles. &quot;I love it!&quot;</p>
<p>Her reaction bolstered Daniel&#39;s confidence. As they continued their walk, he found himself relaxing more, his mind focused on trading quips with Chloe rather than dwelling on the impending crowd.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Daniel and Chloe arrived at the Market Square early, just as they had planned. The area was still relatively quiet, with only a few townsfolk milling about, setting up last-minute decorations. Daniel&#39;s eyes scanned the perimeter, searching for the perfect spot.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; he said, pointing to a small bench nestled beneath an old oak tree. It was set back from the main square, offering a clear view of the proceedings without being in the thick of the crowd.</p>
<p>Chloe nodded approvingly. &quot;Good eye, Daniel. It&#39;s perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>They made their way to the bench and settled in. Daniel immediately feeling more at ease, the familiar roughness of the wooden seat grounding him. Chloe pulled out a thermos from her bag and poured them each a cup of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>As they sipped their drinks, the square began to fill with people. Families arrived bundled in colorful scarves and mittens, their excited chatter filling the air. Daniel watched, fascinated by the patterns of movement as groups formed and dispersed.</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot; Chloe whispered, nudging Daniel gently. She pointed to a group of people gathering near the giant Christmas tree at the center of the square. &quot;The carolers are getting ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the group began to arrange themselves in neat rows. A woman in a bright red coat raised her hands, and suddenly, the crisp night air filled with the sound of harmonious voices singing &quot;Silent Night.&quot;</p>
<p>The atmosphere shifted, becoming more festive with each note. Children stopped running around and listened in awe, their eyes wide with wonder. Couples drew closer together, swaying gently to the music. Even the most hurried of townspeople slowed their pace, caught up in the magic of the moment.</p>
<p>Daniel felt a warmth spread through him that had nothing to do with the hot chocolate. He glanced at Chloe, who was watching the scene with a soft smile on her face. For once, he didn&#39;t feel overwhelmed by the crowd. Instead, he felt a part of something larger, something joyful and communal.</p>
<p>As the carolers transitioned into &quot;Deck the Halls,&quot; more people joined in, their voices rising in a cheerful chorus. The square was now alive with twinkling lights, melodious singing, and the unmistakable spirit of Christmas.</p>
<p>The carolers&#39; final notes faded into the crisp night air, leaving a moment of hushed anticipation. The crowd&#39;s chatter dwindled to a low murmur as attention shifted to the makeshift stage near the grand Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe exchanged a glance, wordlessly agreeing it was time to move. They rose from their bench, careful not to spill the remnants of their hot chocolate. Daniel&#39;s fingers tightened around his cup, the warmth a comforting anchor as they navigated through the sea of people.</p>
<p>They found a spot with a clearer view, not too close to overwhelm Daniel&#39;s senses, but near enough to observe the proceedings. Chloe noticed Daniel&#39;s slight tension and placed a reassuring hand on his arm. He relaxed a fraction, grateful for her understanding.</p>
<p>On stage, a flurry of activity began. The town clerk, a portly man with a receding hairline, bustled about, arranging chairs and testing the microphone with a series of loud taps that made Daniel wince. A group of local dignitaries, recognizable by their formal attire, gathered at the side of the stage, speaking in hushed tones.</p>
<p>The mayor, resplendent in a festive red tie and a well-tailored suit, strode onto the stage with confident steps. His presence commanded attention, and a hush fell over the crowd. He approached the microphone, a broad smile on his face as he surveyed the gathered townsfolk.</p>
<p>&quot;Good evening, Seabourne!&quot; his voice boomed, eliciting a chorus of greetings from the audience. &quot;What a wonderful turnout for our annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony!&quot;</p>
<p>As the mayor launched into his speech, Daniel&#39;s eyes darted around, taking in every detail. He noticed the deputy mayor hovering near the back of the stage, his expression a mix of anticipation and something else Daniel couldn&#39;t quite place. Chloe leaned in close, whispering observations about the crowd&#39;s reactions, helping Daniel understand the emotional undercurrents he might have missed.</p>
<p>The speech continued, filled with warm wishes and community spirit. Daniel found his attention drawn to a table near the edge of the stage, where a large punch bowl sat surrounded by an array of festive cups. A sweet, spicy aroma wafted from it - mulled wine, he realized, recalling the scent from previous years&#39; celebrations.</p>
<hr>
<p>The mayor&#39;s speech drew to a close, his voice rising with enthusiasm as he reached his final words. &quot;And now, my dear friends, let us light up Seabourne with the spirit of Christmas!&quot;</p>
<p>A round of applause erupted from the crowd. Daniel noticed how the sound rippled through the square, starting near the stage and spreading outward like waves on the sea. He glanced at Chloe, who was clapping along with everyone else, her eyes bright with excitement.</p>
<p>Mayor Pompington stepped back from the microphone, his chest puffed out with pride. He reached for a glass of water that sat on a small table next to the podium. Daniel watched as the mayor&#39;s hand closed around the glass, lifting it to his lips. The mayor took a long sip.</p>
<p>Setting the glass down, Mayor Pompington strode across the stage with purpose. His polished shoes clicked against the wooden planks as he made his way to an oversized light switch. It stood almost as tall as the mayor himself, its red and green paint gleaming under the stage lights.</p>
<p>The crowd&#39;s chatter died down as the mayor placed his hand on the switch. He turned to face the audience, his smile wide and infectious. &quot;Are we ready to bring some light to this beautiful night?&quot; he called out.</p>
<p>A chorus of cheers answered him. Daniel felt Chloe squeeze his arm in anticipation. He focused on the mayor, noting how the man&#39;s eyes crinkled at the corners with genuine joy.</p>
<p>&quot;Then let&#39;s count it down together!&quot; Mayor Pompington announced. He raised his free hand, holding up ten fingers. &quot;Ten!&quot; he began, his voice booming across the square.</p>
<p>The crowd joined in, their voices merging into a single, excited chant. &quot;Nine! Eight! Seven!&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel found himself swept up in the moment, his own voice joining Chloe&#39;s as they counted down. &quot;Six! Five! Four!&quot;</p>
<p>The excitement in the air was palpable. Children bounced on their toes, eyes wide with wonder. Adults leaned forward, grins spreading across their faces. &quot;Three! Two! One!&quot;</p>
<p>With a theatrical flourish, Mayor Pompington gripped the oversized switch and pulled it down.</p>
<p>As the switch clicked into place, the enormous Christmas tree burst into life. Thousands of twinkling lights illuminated the square, casting a warm glow over the gathered crowd. A collective gasp of awe rose from the onlookers, followed by enthusiastic cheers and applause.</p>
<p>Daniel blinked, momentarily overwhelmed by the sudden brightness. He felt Chloe&#39;s hand tighten on his arm, her excitement palpable. The tree was a dazzling sight, its branches adorned with ornaments that glittered in the light.</p>
<p>Amidst the celebration, Daniel&#39;s eyes were drawn back to the stage. Mayor Pompington stood there, basking in the success of the moment, his arms spread wide as if to embrace the entire town. But something wasn&#39;t right.</p>
<p>The mayor&#39;s triumphant smile faltered. He took a step forward, his movements suddenly unsteady. Daniel watched, his brow furrowing, as the mayor&#39;s legs seemed to give way beneath him.</p>
<p>Pompington stumbled, his arms flailing as he tried to regain his balance. The crowd&#39;s cheers began to falter, replaced by murmurs of concern. The mayor&#39;s eyes widened in confusion and fear as he lurched towards the podium.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, he grasped the edges of the wooden stand. For a moment, it seemed as though he might steady himself. But then, to the horror of the onlookers, Mayor Pompington&#39;s grip loosened. His eyes rolled back, and he crumpled to the floor of the stage.</p>
<p>The festive atmosphere evaporated in an instant. Gasps and cries of alarm rippled through the crowd. Daniel stood frozen, his mind racing to process what he had just witnessed. Beside him, Chloe&#39;s hand flew to her mouth in shock.</p>
<p>On the stage, the mayor lay motionless, the cheerful lights of the Christmas tree casting an eerie glow over his still form.</p>
<p>As chaos erupted in the square, Henry Davenport pushed his way through the stunned crowd. His face was a mask of concern, but there was a glint in his eye that spoke of something more.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone call an ambulance!&quot; Henry shouted, his voice cutting through the panicked murmurs. He bounded up the steps to the stage, kneeling beside the fallen mayor. &quot;Reggie! Reggie, can you hear me?&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd pressed forward, necks craning to see what was happening. Chloe gripped Daniel&#39;s arm tighter, her eyes wide with shock. Daniel, however, remained still, his gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before them.</p>
<p>As Henry bent over the mayor, checking for signs of life, Inspector Haversham arrived at the scene. The inspector&#39;s weathered face was set in grim determination as he climbed onto the stage, his trench coat flapping behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone, please stay calm and step back,&quot; Haversham commanded, his authoritative voice carrying across the square. He turned to Henry, who was still crouched beside the mayor. &quot;Mr. Davenport, what&#39;s the situation?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry looked up, his face pale. &quot;It&#39;s not good, Inspector. He&#39;s not breathing, and I can&#39;t find a pulse.&quot;</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham nodded grimly. He turned to address the crowd again, raising his hands to quiet the growing murmurs. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please remain where you are until the paramedics have arrived.&quot;</p>
<p>As the inspector spoke, the wail of approaching sirens cut through the night air. The ambulance was on its way, its flashing lights visible in the distance.</p>
<p>Haversham knelt beside the mayor, his experienced eyes taking in every detail. He looked up at Henry, who was still hovering nearby. &quot;Did you see what happened, Mr. Davenport?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry shook his head, his voice shaky. &quot;No, I... I was just watching like everyone else. One moment he was fine, and the next...&quot;</p>
<p>The inspector nodded, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. His eyes landed on Daniel and Chloe, noting their intense focus on the scene.</p>
<p>As the chaos unfolded around them, Daniel&#39;s keen eyes remained fixed on the mayor&#39;s motionless form. Amidst the flashing lights and panicked voices, he noticed something that others had missed. Without a word, he grabbed Chloe&#39;s arm and pulled her closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,&quot; he said, his voice low and urgent. &quot;Look at the mayor&#39;s face. Do you see it?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe squinted, trying to focus on what Daniel was pointing out. &quot;What am I looking for, Daniel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His lips,&quot; Daniel replied, his brow furrowed in concentration. &quot;They&#39;ve turned blue. Why would the mayor&#39;s lips have turned blue?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened as she realized what Daniel was implying. She leaned in closer, her voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Blue lips... that&#39;s not normal, is it? Could it be from the cold?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, his mind racing through possibilities. &quot;No, it&#39;s too warm tonight for that. And it happened so suddenly. This isn&#39;t right, Chloe. Something&#39;s very wrong here.&quot;</p>
<p>As they spoke in hushed tones, the crowd around them continued to buzz with confusion and concern. The ambulance had arrived, and paramedics were rushing to the stage with their equipment.</p>
<p>Daniel turned to Chloe, his eyes intense. &quot;We need to tell Inspector Haversham about this. It could be important.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. &quot;You&#39;re right. But how do we get his attention without causing more panic?&quot;</p>
<p>They watched as Inspector Haversham directed the paramedics and cordoned off the area. Daniel&#39;s mind was working overtime, piecing together the puzzle that was forming before them.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>As Daniel and Chloe debated how to approach Inspector Haversham, the crowd parted. Two paramedics rushed through, their equipment jostling as they hurried towards the stage. Daniel and Chloe stepped back, allowing them to pass.</p>
<p>The paramedics bounded up the steps, their faces set with professional determination. They knelt beside the mayor&#39;s still form, immediately beginning their assessment. The crowd fell silent, tension thick in the air as everyone waited for news.</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham stepped back, giving the medical professionals space to work. His keen eyes scanned the crowd, noting the mix of shock, fear, and curiosity on the faces before him.</p>
<p>For several tense minutes, the paramedics worked over Mayor Pompington. They checked his vitals, administered CPR, and used a defibrillator. The crowd watched in hushed anticipation, hoping against hope for a miracle.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the paramedics stood up and approached Inspector Haversham. He spoke in a low voice, but in the eerie silence that had fallen over the square, his words carried clearly.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Inspector. We&#39;ve done everything we can, but...&quot; The paramedic shook his head solemnly. &quot;The mayor has passed away.&quot;</p>
<p>A collective gasp rippled through the crowd. The festive atmosphere that had filled the square just moments ago evaporated, replaced by a heavy pall of shock and disbelief.</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham&#39;s face hardened. He turned to address the stunned onlookers, his voice steady and authoritative. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mayor Pompington has died. I must ask you all to remain calm and stay where you are. This is now an active crime scene.&quot;</p>
<p>Gasps and murmurs rippled through the crowd as the inspector&#39;s words sank in. Faces went pale, and a palpable sense of shock and disbelief hung in the air.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, who had been standing near the front, let out a soft cry and covered her mouth with her hand. Others began to whisper frantically to their neighbors, the festive mood shattered.</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham turned to two of his officers, who had been standing by, and spoke in a low, urgent tone. &quot;I want you to start taking statements from the crowd. Find out if anyone saw or heard anything unusual. Leave no stone unturned.&quot;</p>
<p>The officers nodded and stepped forward, addressing the people nearest to them. Daniel and Chloe watched as the crowd began to stir, some people stepping forward to speak with the officers while others huddled together, whispering in hushed tones.</p>
<p>Chloe placed a hand on Daniel&#39;s arm, her eyes filled with concern. &quot;Do you think the mayor was... murdered?&quot; she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed as he considered the question. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; he admitted, his gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before them. &quot;But I saw something earlier that didn&#39;t seem right.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened, and she leaned in closer. &quot;What did you see?&quot;</p>
<p>Before Daniel could respond, Inspector Haversham approached them, his expression grim. &quot;Mr. Turner, Miss Bennett,&quot; he said, addressing them directly. &quot;I understand you two were present when this happened. I&#39;ll need to speak with you both.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his expression serious. &quot;Yes, Inspector. I noticed something unusual just before the mayor collapsed.&quot;</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham raised an eyebrow. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When the mayor took a sip from the cup, I noticed a faint bluish tint on his lips,&quot; Daniel explained, his voice steady despite the gravity of the situation. &quot;It was only there for a moment, but it seemed significant.&quot;</p>
<p>The inspector nodded and noted it down in his notebook.</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head. &quot;No, that was the main thing that stood out to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham turned to Chloe. &quot;And you, Miss Bennett? Did you notice anything out of the ordinary?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe hesitated, thinking back to the moments before the mayor&#39;s collapse. &quot;I didn&#39;t see anything specific,&quot; she admitted.</p>
<p>The inspector nodded, jotting down notes in a small notebook. &quot;Thank you, you&#39;re free to leave.&quot;</p>
<p>As Inspector Haversham moved on to question other witnesses, Daniel felt a growing sense of unease. The bluish tint on the mayor&#39;s lips, the sudden collapse, the shocked reactions of the crowd—it all pointed to something more sinister than a simple accident.</p>
<p>Chloe sensed Daniel&#39;s disquiet and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asked softly.</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, his brow furrowed. &quot;No, not really. I can&#39;t stop thinking about what I saw. It doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The bluish tint, the way the mayor collapsed... it reminds me of something I&#39;ve read about before. Something to do with poisons.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Poison? You think the mayor was poisoned?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged, his expression troubled. &quot;I don&#39;t know for sure, but it&#39;s a possibility. And if that&#39;s the case, then this wasn&#39;t an accident. It was murder.&quot;</p>
<p>The weight of Daniel&#39;s words hung heavy in the air. The thought that someone might have deliberately harmed the mayor, a man who was loved and respected by the community, was deeply unsettling.</p>
<p>As the crowd began to disperse, their faces etched with shock and grief, Daniel felt a growing determination to uncover the truth. He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was more to this tragedy than met the eye, and he knew he wouldn&#39;t be able to rest until he understood what had really happened.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe left the market square, their footsteps heavy as they walked back to Daniel&#39;s house. The festive atmosphere had evaporated, replaced by a somber mood that hung over the town like a thick fog.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe what happened,&quot; Chloe said, her voice barely above a whisper. &quot;The mayor seemed fine just moments before...&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his mind racing. &quot;It was so sudden. But there&#39;s something about those blue lips that keeps nagging at me.&quot;</p>
<p>As they turned onto Daniel&#39;s street, he suddenly stopped in his tracks. &quot;Wait, I remember now. Cyanide!&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe looked at him, confused. &quot;Cyanide?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Daniel explained, his words coming faster now. &quot;Cyanide causes blue lips by interfering with the body&#39;s ability to process oxygen. It leads to hypoxia - a lack of oxygen in the tissues.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued as they resumed walking. &quot;The symptoms of hypoxia include confusion, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. That&#39;s exactly what we saw happen to the mayor on stage.&quot;</p>
<p>They arrived at Daniel&#39;s house, his mind still whirling with the implications of his realization. Without pausing, he opened the door and stepped inside, leaving Chloe standing on the porch.</p>
<p>Chloe shook her head and laughed softly at Daniel&#39;s unintentional rudeness. It was so typical of him to get lost in his thoughts and forget social niceties.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>When Daniel arrived home, he was relieved to find the house empty. The silence allowed his mind to focus on the puzzle at hand. Striding into the kitchen, he poured himself a glass of water and sat down at the kitchen table, his fingers drumming against the worn wooden surface.</p>
<p>The mayor&#39;s sudden collapse and those strange blue lips nagged at him. Cyanide poisoning – it made sense, but how? Who would want to murder the mayor, and more importantly, how did they do it?</p>
<p>Daniel took a sip of water, letting the cool liquid soothe his parched throat. His gaze drifted around the familiar kitchen, seeking comfort in the routine details. The ticking of the old clock on the wall, the faint scent of beeswax from the polished table – these small, predictable things helped ground him.</p>
<p>His thoughts returned to the case, methodically piecing together the information he had. The mayor had taken a sip from a communal cup during the ceremony. Had the killer tampered with the drink beforehand, knowing the mayor would be the first to partake? It was a clever, calculated move, the kind of plan that required foresight and patience.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s eyes narrowed as he considered the possibilities. Who in Seabourne would have the motive and the means to pull off such a crime? His mind raced, sifting through the list of suspects.</p>
<p>Daniel looked up as Mrs. Harding entered the kitchen, her presence immediately calming his racing thoughts. She moved with a quiet confidence, her sharp eyes taking in his pensive expression.</p>
<p>Settling into the chair across from him, Mrs. Harding asked gently, &quot;How are you feeling, Daniel?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel met her gaze, grateful for the concern in her voice. &quot;I...I&#39;m worried, Mrs. Harding. About the mayor&#39;s death. I think he was murdered.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel leaned forward, his blue eyes intense with purpose. &quot;I think the mayor was murdered, Mrs. Harding. And I&#39;m going to find out what happened.&quot;</p>
<p>The older woman studied him for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, a small smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. &quot;I had a feeling you might say that.&quot; She folded her hands on the table, her gaze steady. &quot;What makes you so sure it wasn&#39;t an accident?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel launched into an explanation, his words flowing with a rare urgency. &quot;The blue tint on his lips – it&#39;s a sign of cyanide poisoning. I remember reading about it in one of my books. And the timing, right after he took a sip from that cup...&quot; He shook his head, his brow furrowed. &quot;It&#39;s too perfect to be a coincidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding listened intently, her eyes narrowing slightly. &quot;So you think someone tampered with the drink, knowing the mayor would be the first to taste it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Daniel nodded, his fingers tapping against the tabletop. &quot;It was a calculated move, one that required planning and patience. And I intend to find out who was behind it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding&#39;s expression remained calm, but a subtle edge of concern crept into her voice. &quot;I don&#39;t think you should meddle in the investigation, Daniel.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed as he opened his mouth to protest, but Mrs. Harding raised a hand, silencing him. &quot;Listen to me, Daniel. If you&#39;re correct and the mayor was murdered, then someone in this town is a dangerous killer. That person is not going to hesitate to protect their secret.&quot;</p>
<p>She leaned forward, her eyes searching his face. &quot;Remember, they&#39;ve already killed once. They probably won&#39;t flinch at killing again, especially if they feel threatened.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel felt a chill run down his spine at her words. The thought of a murderer roaming the streets of Seabourne, ready to strike again, made his stomach twist with unease. &quot;Yes, Mrs. Harding,&quot; he said quietly, the fight draining from his voice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding&#39;s expression softened, and she reached across the table to give his hand a gentle squeeze. &quot;I know you want to help, Daniel, and I admire your determination. But this is a job for the authorities. Your safety is what matters most to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his gaze dropping to the table. He understood her concerns, but a part of him still yearned to uncover the truth. The logical puzzle of it all tugged at him, urging him to investigate further.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Mrs. Harding&#39;s voice broke the tension. &quot;Good. Now, what do you fancy for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, a small, grateful smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. &quot;Anything you make will be perfect, Mrs. Harding. You know I always enjoy your cooking.&quot;</p>
<p>The older woman returned his smile, her eyes crinkling at the corners. &quot;That&#39;s my boy. Now, how about a nice shepherd&#39;s pie? It&#39;ll stick to your ribs and warm you up on this chilly evening.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his shoulders relaxing. &quot;Shepherd&#39;s pie sounds wonderful.&quot;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Harding bustled about the kitchen, Daniel allowed himself to be soothed by the familiar sounds and smells. The promise of a hearty meal and the comforting presence of his caretaker helped to ease the turmoil of his thoughts, if only for a moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel sat at the kitchen table, wearing a comfortable pair of flannel pajamas as he spooned up the last bite of his Coco Pops. The rich chocolate flavor melted on his tongue, a small pleasure in the midst of the turmoil swirling in his mind.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to place the empty bowl in the sink, Chloe breezed into the kitchen, her warm brown eyes sparkling with amusement.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice pajamas,&quot; she said with a teasing smile.</p>
<p>Daniel felt a flush creep up his neck as he glanced down at the worn, plaid fabric. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he mumbled, suddenly self-conscious.</p>
<p>Chloe moved closer, peering into his empty bowl. &quot;What were you eating? Coco Pops?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Daniel replied, relaxing a bit at her casual tone. &quot;They&#39;re my favorite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yum,&quot; Chloe said, her gaze softening. &quot;I could go for a bowl of that right about now.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel quickly retrieved a clean bowl and poured a generous serving of Coco Pops and handed it to Chloe.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you go,&quot; he said, offering her a spoon.</p>
<p>Chloe accepted the bowl with a grateful smile. &quot;Thanks, Daniel.&quot; She took a seat at the kitchen table, across from him, and began to eat.</p>
<p>For a few moments, the only sound was the clink of Chloe&#39;s spoon against the ceramic as she savored each bite. Daniel sat quietly, watching her, his own empty bowl pushed aside.</p>
<p>Finally, Chloe looked up, her eyes meeting his. &quot;Have you thought any more about the murder?&quot; she asked gently.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed, and he shook his head. &quot;No, too dangerous,&quot; he said, his voice low and uncertain.</p>
<p>Chloe took another bite of her cereal, chewing thoughtfully. &quot;You must have some ideas about what happened,&quot; she said, her voice gentle.</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, his gaze dropping to the tabletop. &quot;No, Mrs. Harding told me it&#39;s too dangerous to get involved,&quot; he murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...&quot; Chloe&#39;s spoon paused mid-bite, and she studied Daniel&#39;s troubled expression.</p>
<p>Daniel glanced up, his blue eyes shining with a mixture of concern and curiosity. &quot;But I can&#39;t stop thinking about it,&quot; he whispered, his words barely audible.</p>
<p>Chloe nodded slowly, understanding dawning on her face. &quot;Maybe you should do what you think is right,&quot; she said, her tone encouraging.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed as he considered her words. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; he admitted, his gaze shifting to the window, where the first hints of dawn were peeking through. &quot;Mrs. Harding is probably right, it could be dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded again, her own expression thoughtful. &quot;Hmm, she probably is.&quot;</p>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Daniel spent the day in the Seabourne Craft Workshop, the rhythmic whir of the lathe and the scent of freshly sanded wood providing a familiar comfort. His fingers danced across the spinning wood, coaxing the raw material into a graceful bowl.</p>
<p>As he worked, his mind kept returning to the events of the previous night. The way the mayor&#39;s lips had taken on that faint bluish tint, the unsettling detail that had nagged at him ever since. Daniel knew he should heed Mrs. Harding&#39;s advice and stay out of the investigation, but the mystery continued to pull at him.</p>
<p>Daniel stopped the lathe, letting the bowl come to a gentle stop. He picked it up, running his fingers over the smooth, rounded surface. The grain of the wood was exquisite, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of pride in his work.</p>
<p>Grabbing a tin of Yorkshire grit, to begin the process of finishing the bowl, carefully applying the abrasive in even strokes. But as he lifted the lid, he noticed the tin was empty. Frowning, he set the bowl down and walked over to the bin, intending to discard the empty container.</p>
<p>Daniel spotted the bowl he had turned the day before nestled in the bin. He reached in and carefully pulled it out, running his fingers over the smooth surface.</p>
<p>As he inspected the piece, his gaze landed on a small imperfection in the wood - a tiny knot that he had meticulously sanded down, yet still remained visible. Daniel traced the blemish with his fingertip, his brow furrowing in concentration.</p>
<p>The image of the mayor&#39;s bluish lips flashed through his mind, the unsettling detail that had piqued his curiosity. Daniel knew he shouldn&#39;t get involved, that Mrs. Harding had warned him about the risks. But the parallels between the imperfection in the wood and the subtle clue he had noticed at the tree lighting ceremony were impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>As the day drew to a close, Daniel made his way back to the home he shared with Mrs. Harding and the other residents. The workshop had provided a welcome respite, but now that he was away from the familiar rhythm of his work, the events of the previous night began to weigh heavily on his mind.</p>
<p>Daniel greeted Mrs. Harding with a distracted nod, barely registering her concerned expression as he climbed the stairs to his room. Once inside, he changed into his pajamas, the soft fabric offering little comfort as he settled onto his bed.</p>
<p>Try as he might, Daniel couldn&#39;t shake the image of the mayor&#39;s lifeless body, the bluish tint on his lips a haunting reminder of the mystery that had unfolded. He replayed the scene in his mind, searching for any other clues he might have missed, any details that could help unravel the truth.</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s words from earlier echoed in his thoughts, urging him to trust his instincts and pursue the investigation. But the risks were real, and Daniel couldn&#39;t ignore the weight of Mrs. Harding&#39;s warning. He knew the dangers of getting too deeply involved, the potential consequences that could ripple through the tight-knit community.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, Daniel tossed and turned, his mind refusing to quiet. The shadows in his room seemed to press in, and the familiar sounds of the house became unsettling. He longed for the comfort of his workshop, the soothing rhythm of the lathe and the predictable patterns of his craft.</p>
<p>Daniel woke with a start, the first rays of morning sun filtering through his curtains. He glanced at the clock and groaned - he was running late. Quickly dressing, he made his way downstairs, the familiar scents of the home comforting him.</p>
<p>As he entered the kitchen, he found Chloe and Mrs. Harding already seated at the table, mugs of steaming tea in front of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, sleepy head,&quot; Chloe greeted him with a warm smile.</p>
<p>Daniel frowned, the events of the previous night still weighing heavily on his mind. &quot;Huh.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding looked up from her mug, a hint of concern in her voice. &quot;Someone&#39;s a little grumpy this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel opened the cupboard, scanning the shelves for his favorite cereal. &quot;Where&#39;s the coco pops?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, I meant to buy some yesterday,&quot; Mrs. Harding replied. &quot;I&#39;ll get some later today. There&#39;s some other cereal, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel groaned, the prospect of a less-than-ideal breakfast adding to his frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like me to make you a bacon bap?&quot; Mrs. Harding offered, her tone gentle.</p>
<p>Daniel felt the tension in his shoulders ease slightly, and he offered a small smile. &quot;Yes, please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe?&quot; Mrs. Harding turned to the young woman sitting beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes please,&quot; Chloe responded, her eyes filled with understanding as she met Daniel&#39;s gaze.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding moved with practiced efficiency, assembling the bacon baps. She could sense the tension in Daniel&#39;s demeanor and hoped a hearty breakfast would help settle his mood.</p>
<p>As she placed the steaming sandwiches in front of them, she gave Chloe&#39;s shoulder a gentle squeeze. &quot;Eat up, you two. I&#39;ve got a few things to take care of, but I&#39;ll be back shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled gratefully at Mrs. Harding, then turned her attention to Daniel. &quot;Here, try this,&quot; she said, handing him one of the baps.</p>
<p>Daniel took the sandwich, the warmth of the bread and the savory aroma of the bacon helping to soothe his frazzled nerves. He took a bite, chewing slowly as Chloe watched him, her expression patient and understanding.</p>
<p>After a moment, Chloe spoke softly. &quot;How are you feeling this morning? I know what happened to the Mayor was...well, it was a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel swallowed the bite of food, his brow furrowed as he tried to find the right words. &quot;I...I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t stop thinking about it, about what I saw. That detail, the mayor&#39;s lips, it just keeps bothering me.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, her eyes filled with empathy. &quot;I know. And I&#39;m glad you noticed it. It could be an important clue, something that might help us figure out what really happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, his gaze meeting Chloe&#39;s. &quot;You think I should try to investigate it? But Mrs. Harding, she warned me about the risks. I don&#39;t want to cause any trouble, or get in over my head.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe reached across the table, placing her hand over his. &quot;I understand your concerns, Daniel. But you have a gift for seeing things that others miss. And I...I think we could really help, if we work together. I&#39;ll be right here with you, every step of the way.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel finished his breakfast, the savory flavors helping to settle his nerves. With a grateful nod to Mrs. Harding, he pushed back his chair and made his way upstairs to get dressed.</p>
<p>As he changed into a clean shirt and a pair of sturdy jeans, his mind raced. The mayor&#39;s collapse, that strange bluish tint on his lips - it all seemed so out of place, so unnatural. Daniel couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.</p>
<p>Tugging on his worn leather boots, Daniel took a deep breath and headed back downstairs, where he found Chloe and Mrs. Harding deep in conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;...and that&#39;s why I&#39;m worried, dear,&quot; Mrs. Harding was saying, her brow furrowed with concern. &quot;The mayor&#39;s death, it&#39;s bound to stir up all sorts of trouble. I don&#39;t want you two getting caught up in something that could put you in harm&#39;s way.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, her expression earnest. &quot;I understand, Mrs. Harding. But you know how important it is to Daniel to get to the bottom of this. And I&#39;ll be right there with him, every step of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding sighed, her gaze shifting to Daniel as he entered the room. &quot;Daniel, my boy, I know you&#39;ve got a keen eye for details, but this is a delicate situation. I don&#39;t want you to feel obligated to investigate, not if it&#39;s going to put you in danger.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel hesitated, his fingers fidgeting with the cuff of his shirt. &quot;I...I know the risks, Mrs. Harding. But I can&#39;t stop thinking about what I saw. That detail, it just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe reached out and gave his arm a gentle squeeze. &quot;We&#39;ll be careful, Mrs. Harding. And we&#39;ll come to you if we need any help or advice.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding studied the pair, her sharp eyes assessing their determination. After a moment, she let out a resigned sigh. &quot;Alright, but promise me you&#39;ll be cautious. And if things start to get out of hand, you come to me right away, you hear?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, a hint of relief in his expression. &quot;We will, Mrs. Harding. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. &quot;So, what&#39;s our first move, Daniel?&quot;</p>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stepped into the warmth of Rosie&#39;s Café, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods enveloping them. The cozy interior, with its mismatched furniture and charming decor, felt like a welcome respite from the chilly air outside.</p>
<p>Chloe led the way to a small table by the window, where they could watch the bustling activity of the town square. As they settled into their seats, Chloe caught Rosie&#39;s eye and waved her over.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, you two!&quot; Rosie greeted them with her trademark friendly smile. &quot;What can I get for you today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, Rosie,&quot; Chloe replied. &quot;I&#39;ll have a large coffee and a slice of your chocolate cake, please. And the same for Daniel, if that&#39;s alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded in agreement, his gaze momentarily drifting to the pastry display before returning to Chloe.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming right up!&quot; Rosie said, jotting down their order. &quot;I&#39;ll bring it over as soon as it&#39;s ready.&quot;</p>
<p>As Rosie hurried back to the kitchen, Chloe turned to Daniel, her expression a mix of concern and determination.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, let&#39;s talk about what happened the other night,&quot; she said, her voice low. &quot;What exactly did you see that made you so sure something was wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel leaned forward, his brow furrowed in concentration as he recounted the events of the Christmas tree lighting ceremony.</p>
<p>&quot;When the mayor collapsed, I noticed his lips had a strange bluish tint,&quot; he explained, his words measured and precise. &quot;It reminded me of something I&#39;d read about before – how certain poisons can cause that kind of reaction in the body.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe listened intently, her eyes widening as the implications sank in. &quot;You think the mayor was poisoned?&quot; she asked, her voice hushed.</p>
<p>Before Daniel could respond, Rosie arrived with their orders, a tray laden with steaming mugs of coffee and a decadent slice of chocolate cake for each of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you go, you two,&quot; Rosie said, setting the tray down on the table. She couldn&#39;t help but overhear their conversation and her brow furrowed with concern. &quot;Poisoned, you say? What on earth are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal, but Chloe spoke up, her expression earnest.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the mayor&#39;s death might not have been an accident, Rosie,&quot; she explained. &quot;Daniel spotted something.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie&#39;s eyes widened, and she glanced around the café, as if to ensure no one else was eavesdropping. &quot;That&#39;s a serious accusation,&quot; she murmured, pulling up a chair and joining them at the table. &quot;What makes you think that?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. &quot;The mayor&#39;s lips had a distinct bluish tint when he collapsed,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve read about how certain poisons can cause that kind of discoloration. It wasn&#39;t something that would happen naturally.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie&#39;s brow furrowed as she considered his words, her fingers drumming lightly on the tabletop. &quot;Well, that is certainly an interesting observation,&quot; she mused. &quot;And you think someone might have...poisoned the mayor?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, Chloe, and Rosie sat in a hushed silence for a moment. Rosie broke the silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if you two think the mayor&#39;s death wasn&#39;t an accident, then I suppose you&#39;ll be wanting to find out what really happened,&quot; Rosie said, her expression serious. &quot;And I can&#39;t say I blame you. Reggie was a good man, and he didn&#39;t deserve to go out like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, her eyes filled with determination. &quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re going to look into it, Rosie. We have to know the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie reached across the table and gave Chloe&#39;s hand a gentle squeeze. &quot;I admire your gumption, you two,&quot; she said, her gaze shifting between the two of them. &quot;If anyone can get to the bottom of this, it&#39;s you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shifted in his seat, his fingers drumming lightly on the tabletop. &quot;We&#39;ll need to investigate carefully,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rosie nodded, her expression thoughtful. &quot;Well, you know I&#39;ll be keeping my ears open for any juicy bits of gossip that might be useful,&quot; she said, a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. &quot;You two just focus on your cakes and coffees for now. Leave the eavesdropping to me.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, Rosie rose from the table, her apron swishing as she headed back toward the counter.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe were left alone, their steaming mugs of coffee and slices of chocolate cake sitting untouched before them. Chloe glanced at Daniel, a small smile playing on her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I guess we&#39;d better eat up,&quot; she said, picking up her fork and taking a bite of the rich, decadent cake. &quot;Can&#39;t solve a mystery on an empty stomach, can we?&quot;</p>
<p>When they had finished their cakes and drained the last of their coffee, they rose from the table and made their way to the counter, where Rosie was waiting with a warm smile.</p>
<p>&quot;All done, are we?&quot; she asked, her eyes twinkling. &quot;Well, you two just let me know if there&#39;s anything else I can do to help. I&#39;ll be keeping my eyes and ears open for any juicy bits of information that might be useful.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe exchanged a grateful look, and Chloe reached out to give Rosie&#39;s hand a squeeze.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Rosie,&quot; she said, her voice sincere. &quot;We really appreciate it.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, they turned and headed out of the café, their minds already racing with the possibilities of what they might uncover.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe left the warmth of Rosie&#39;s Café, the chilly sea breeze biting at their faces as they made their way up the hill toward the police station. Chloe glanced over at Daniel, noticing the tense set of his shoulders and the slight furrow in his brow.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you doing okay?&quot; she asked gently, reaching out to lightly touch his arm.</p>
<p>Daniel gave a small nod, his gaze fixed straight ahead. &quot;Just...thinking,&quot; he replied, his voice quiet.</p>
<p>Chloe fell into step beside him, her own pace slowing to match his. &quot;I know this is a big step,&quot; she said, her tone reassuring. &quot;But we&#39;re in this together, okay? I&#39;ve got your back.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s steps faltered for a moment, and he turned to look at Chloe, his blue eyes searching her face. &quot;I...I appreciate that, Chloe,&quot; he said, the tension in his expression easing slightly. &quot;I just want to make sure we&#39;re doing the right thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are,&quot; Chloe replied firmly. &quot;The mayor deserves justice, and if there&#39;s something more to his death, we have to at least try to uncover the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his gaze drifting back to the path ahead. They continued walking in companionable silence, the wind whipping around them as they approached the imposing facade of the police station.</p>
<p>Chloe paused, turning to face Daniel fully. &quot;Are you ready for this?&quot; she asked, her expression open and understanding.</p>
<p>Daniel took a deep breath, squaring his shoulders. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, his voice steadier than it had been a moment ago. &quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;</p>
<p>Together, they pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped into the warm, brightly lit interior of the police station. The air was thick with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the murmur of voices as officers went about their duties.</p>
<p>Chloe led the way to the front desk, where a young officer sat, his eyes trained on the computer screen in front of him. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Chloe said, her voice polite but firm. &quot;We&#39;d like to speak with Inspector Haversham, please.&quot;</p>
<p>The officer looked up, his brow furrowing slightly. &quot;Do you have an appointment?&quot; he asked, his tone professional but slightly wary.</p>
<p>&quot;No, but it&#39;s regarding the mayor&#39;s death,&quot; Chloe replied. &quot;We have some information that we believe the inspector should hear.&quot;</p>
<p>The officer&#39;s eyes widened, and he straightened in his chair. &quot;One moment, please,&quot; he said, picking up the phone and quickly placing a call.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe waited, the tension in the air palpable as they watched the officer speak in hushed tones. Finally, he hung up the phone and turned his attention back to them.</p>
<p>&quot;The inspector will see you now,&quot; he said, gesturing toward a hallway. &quot;Just go down that way and his office will be on the left.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, giving him an encouraging nod. &quot;Ready?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Daniel took a deep breath and nodded, his expression resolute. &quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stepped into Inspector Haversham&#39;s office, the familiar scent of old paperwork and stale coffee filling the air. The inspector looked up from his desk, his brow furrowing slightly as he regarded the two young investigators.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel, Chloe,&quot; he greeted them,. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel took a deep breath, his gaze unable to met the inspector&#39;s eyes and resting on an oil stain on his tie instead. &quot;Inspector, I believe the mayor&#39;s death was not an accident,&quot; he began, his voice coming out too soft. &quot;When I saw him collapse at the tree lighting ceremony, I noticed a distinct bluish tint to his lips. That, combined with the speed of his death, leads me to believe he was poisoned,&quot; he continues, his voice a little louder.</p>
<p>Inspector Haversham&#39;s brow furrowed as he listened to Daniel&#39;s explanation. &quot;I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, Daniel,&quot; he said, his tone measured. &quot;However, the official report from the coroner states that the mayor&#39;s death was due to natural causes - a heart attack, likely brought on by his pre-existing condition.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe spoke up then, her voice calm and steady. &quot;Did the coroner check for signs of poisoning? Couldn&#39;t the bluish tint on the mayor&#39;s lips be an indication of something more sinister?&quot;</p>
<p>The inspector leaned back in his chair, a heavy sigh escaping his lips. &quot;I understand your concerns, but the fact is, we simply don&#39;t have the resources or the evidence to pursue any other line of inquiry at this time,&quot; he explained. &quot;The mayor had a history of heart disease, and his death, while tragic, appears to be a natural occurrence.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel fidgeted uncomfortably, his gaze finally meeting the inspector&#39;s. &quot;But what if it&#39;s not?&quot; he pressed, his voice tinged with a hint of frustration. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we at least consider the possibility that he was...that he was murdered?&quot;</p>
<p>Haversham raised a hand, silencing Daniel. &quot;I know you both have a keen eye for detail, and I respect that,&quot; he said. &quot;But in this case, the evidence simply doesn&#39;t support a murder investigation. The coroner&#39;s report is clear, and without any other compelling evidence, my hands are tied.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, seeing the disappointment written across his features. She reached out and gently squeezed his arm, offering him a sympathetic smile. &quot;I understand, Inspector,&quot; she said, her voice soft.</p>
<p>The inspector nodded, his expression softening slightly. &quot;Now, I&#39;d suggest you both focus your energies elsewhere. This case is closed, as far as the police are concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, he gestured towards the door, signaling that the meeting was over. Daniel and Chloe exchanged a look, their disappointment palpable, before turning and making their way out of the station.</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel stepped out of the police station, the heavy wooden door swinging shut behind them. The crisp sea air hit their faces, and Chloe couldn&#39;t help but notice the defeated slump in Daniel&#39;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess that&#39;s it then,&quot; Chloe said, her voice soft.</p>
<p>Daniel remained silent for a moment, his brow furrowed in thought. Then, he turned to Chloe, his blue eyes filled with determination.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t think so,&quot; he replied, his voice firm.</p>
<p>Chloe could see the frustration simmering beneath the surface. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked, falling into step beside him as they made their way down the hill towards the Seabourne Craft Workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;The mayor was murdered, I know it,&quot; Daniel said, his pace quickening. &quot;And I&#39;m going to prove it.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe felt a surge of both concern and admiration. She knew how important this was to Daniel, how his logical mind simply couldn&#39;t accept the official explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;But the inspector said the evidence doesn&#39;t support a murder investigation,&quot; Chloe reminded him gently. &quot;What if he&#39;s right?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, his expression resolute. &quot;They&#39;re wrong, Chloe. I saw it with my own eyes – the mayor&#39;s lips were blue, and he collapsed too quickly for it to be a heart attack.&quot;</p>
<p>As they reached the workshop, Daniel pulled open the door, the familiar scent of wood shavings and oil filling the air. He strode over to his workbench, Chloe following close behind.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to keep looking,&quot; Daniel said, his hands already rifling through a stack of papers and notebooks. &quot;There has to be something – some clue, some detail that the police overlooked.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe watched him, her heart swelling with a mix of admiration and concern. She knew how important this was to him, how he couldn&#39;t let it go. And she also knew that she would be by his side, no matter what.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Chloe said, placing a gentle hand on his arm. &quot;Where do we start?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel paused, his gaze meeting hers. &quot;We start by looking at everything we know,&quot; he said, his voice calm but determined. &quot;And then we find the truth, no matter what it takes.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, a small smile playing at the corners of her lips. &quot;I&#39;m with you, Daniel,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stood at the workbench. He scanning the pages of his notebook. The lines of tiny, precise handwriting filled the pages with details he had observed during the mayor&#39;s collapse, snippets of conversations he&#39;d overheard, and thoughts on what they might mean. Each note represented a piece of a puzzle he was determined to solve.</p>
<p>The creak of the workshop door broke their concentration. Both Daniel and Chloe turned to see who had entered, their minds momentarily pulled from the investigation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding walked into the workshop, her presence filling the space with warmth and authority. The sunlight caught the strands of her salt-and-pepper hair, making it gleam as she approached.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, look at you two, deep in thought as always,&quot; she said, her voice laced with a hint of amusement. Her blue eyes sparkled with curiosity as she took in the scene—Daniel hunched over his notes, Chloe peering over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“What’s got you both so serious?” she asked, hands resting on her hips, the no-nonsense air about her unwavering.</p>
<p>Daniel felt a rush of warmth at her presence, but the weight of the mayor’s death loomed heavily in his mind. He exchanged a glance with Chloe, their silent agreement lingering in the air, before responding.</p>
<p>Daniel looked up at Mrs. Harding, his expression a mix of determination and uncertainty. &quot;We went to the police station to speak with Inspector Haversham about the mayor&#39;s death,&quot; he began, his words measured and precise. &quot;The police believe it was due to natural causes.&quot;</p>
<p>A small smile tugged at the corners of Mrs. Harding&#39;s mouth. &quot;I&#39;ve been hearing all sorts of wild rumors around town today, you know. Some folks are convinced the mayor was cursed, others think it was a secret lover&#39;s quarrel gone wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed as he listened, and Chloe couldn&#39;t help but let out a soft laugh. &quot;Cursed? Really? That&#39;s a new one,&quot; she said, her eyes sparkling with amusement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding chuckled, the sound warm and comforting. &quot;Oh, yes. And you won&#39;t believe what some of the other townsfolk are saying. Apparently, the mayor was running a smuggling ring out of the harbor, and someone finally caught up with him.&quot;</p>
<p>The three of them shared a moment of laughter, the tension in the room dissipating as they indulged in the absurdity of the gossip. When the laughter died down, Mrs. Harding turned to Chloe, her expression softening.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking of which, Chloe, would you be joining Daniel and me for dinner tonight? I&#39;ve got a fresh batch of my famous apple crumble, and I&#39;d hate for it to go to waste.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, who gave her a small nod, and then turned back to Mrs. Harding. &quot;I&#39;d love to, thank you,&quot; she said, a warm smile spreading across her face.</p>
<p>With a satisfied nod, Mrs. Harding made her way back to the door, pausing to look over her shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t stay in here too long, you two. Dinner&#39;s at six, and I won&#39;t accept any excuses for being late.&quot;</p>
<p>As the door closed behind her, Daniel and Chloe turned their attention back to the notebook, their focus once again laser-sharp as they delved into the mysteries that lay within.</p>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>Chloe walked into the kitchen to find Daniel sitting at the table eating Coco Pops. His notebook lay open in front of him. He spun his pen over his fingers, then added a note to the book. Chloe helped herself to a bowl of Coco Pops and sat down opposite Daniel. She ate the cereal in silence, knowing better than to disturb Daniel while he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>Chloe watched as Daniel finished his cereal, his brow furrowed in concentration. When he had polished off the last bite, he looked up and greeted her.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning, Chloe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what are the plans for today?&quot; Chloe asked, setting down her empty bowl.</p>
<p>Daniel didn&#39;t hesitate. &quot;We need to start looking into the obvious suspects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And they are?&quot; Chloe prompted.</p>
<p>Daniel began ticking them off on his fingers. &quot;One - Mrs Pompington. I read that most murders are close family members, so Mrs Pompington is first on my list.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyebrows rose in surprise. &quot;Mrs Pompington? But she&#39;s so sweet.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel waved a dismissive hand. &quot;Two - Henry Davenport - everyone knows he holds a grudge against the mayor since he lost the election.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe hummed thoughtfully. &quot;Hmm, I&#39;m not sure Henry has it in him. Anyone else?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head. &quot;Not yet, but I&#39;m sure some more will surface.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel jumped up suddenly, grabbing his house keys. &quot;Come on, Chloe, we need to hurry,&quot; he said, rushing to the front door.</p>
<p>Chloe quickly joined him, following him out onto the pavement. &quot;What&#39;s the rush?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The bus to Mrs. Pompington&#39;s house will be arriving soon,&quot; Daniel explained as they briskly walked to the bus stop.</p>
<p>Just as they reached the stop, the bus pulled up. Daniel and Chloe boarded, finding empty seats near the front. The bus pulled away and headed out of town.</p>
<p>Soon the bus rumbled along the winding country road, carrying Daniel and Chloe closer to their destination. Chloe glanced over at her friend, who was staring out the window, lost in thought.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want to ask Margaret Pompington?&quot; Chloe asked, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>Daniel turned to face her, his brow furrowed. &quot;I&#39;d like to know how bad the mayor&#39;s health was.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, waiting for him to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that it?&quot; she prompted.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Daniel said, a hint of uncertainty in his voice. &quot;I need to find out how things were between her and her husband.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes, that&#39;ll be important,&quot; Chloe agreed, understanding dawning on her face.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, then added, &quot;I also want to ask her if she knows anyone who might have had a reason to hurt her husband.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled encouragingly at Daniel. &quot;Do you want me to do the talking?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded enthusiastically. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, relieved that Chloe was willing to take the lead.</p>
<p>The bus slowed as it approached the stop, and Chloe placed a reassuring hand on Daniel&#39;s arm. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got this,&quot; she said, giving him a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p>As the bus came to a halt, Chloe and Daniel disembarked, their footsteps crunching on the gravel path that led to Margaret Pompington&#39;s house. Chloe took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the conversation ahead, while Daniel followed close behind, his eyes scanning the area for any clues that might help unravel the mystery.</p>
<p>Chloe took in the grandeur of the Pompington house as she and Daniel approached the front door. The large, stately manor stood before them, its well-manicured gardens and gleaming white facade a testament to the family&#39;s wealth and status within the community.</p>
<p>Chloe took a deep breath, then reached out and knocked firmly on the heavy wooden door. She waited, listening for any signs of movement from within, but the house remained silent. Beside her, Daniel shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his eyes scanning the area for any clues.</p>
<p>After a moment, Chloe tried the doorbell, its chime echoing through the stillness. They waited, but still there was no response. Chloe glanced at Daniel, who gave her an encouraging nod.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door swung open, and there stood Mrs. Pompington, impeccably dressed in a crisp blouse and tailored skirt. Her silver hair was perfectly coiffed, and her face, though slightly guarded, showed no obvious signs of distress.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I help you?&quot; she asked, her voice calm and composed.</p>
<p>Chloe smiled warmly at Mrs. Pompington. &quot;Good morning, Mrs. Pompington. I&#39;m Chloe Bennett, and this is my friend Daniel Turner. We were wondering if we could talk to you about the mayor&#39;s death. We know it must be a difficult time, but we were hoping you could help us understand what happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington&#39;s expression softened slightly. &quot;Of course, please come in.&quot; She stepped aside, allowing Chloe and Daniel to enter the grand foyer. &quot;This way, to the living room.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel followed Mrs. Pompington through the spacious, well-appointed home. The living room was elegantly furnished, with plush armchairs and a large fireplace. Mrs. Pompington gestured for them to have a seat.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I offer you some tea and scones?&quot; she asked, her tone polite but reserved. &quot;I just finished baking a fresh batch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be lovely, thank you,&quot; Chloe replied, taking a seat on the sofa. Daniel sat beside her, his eyes scanning the room, taking in every detail.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington stepped out of the room, returning moments later with a tray bearing a teapot, cups, and a plate of warm scones topped with jam and cream. She set it down on the coffee table and poured the tea, handing a cup to each of her guests.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, help yourselves,&quot; she said, taking a seat in an armchair across from them.</p>
<p>Chloe picked up a scone, taking a bite and savoring the sweet flavors. &quot;These are delicious, Mrs. Pompington. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel followed suit, taking a scone and dipping it into his tea. He took a few bites, his gaze fixed on Mrs. Pompington.</p>
<p>Chloe set down her scone and turned to their host. &quot;Mrs. Pompington, we know this must be a very difficult time for you. We&#39;re so sorry for your loss. We were hoping you could tell us a bit more about what happened at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Did the mayor have any health issues that you were aware of?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Pompington smiled at Chloe, then replied in her polite tone, &quot;Unfortunately Reggie had a heart attack earlier this year. He underwent double bypass surgery and had a couple of stents inserted.&quot; She voice trembled a little and she cleared her throat, before continuing, &quot;He was doing so well though. He&#39;d lost over two stone, was eating healthily and had cut back on the drink. It wasn&#39;t easy for him, not in his job.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel took out his notebook and wrote a few notes, then showed them to Chloe. Chloe nodded to Daniel then smiled at Mrs Pompington. &quot;I imagine it must have been difficult, what with all the parties,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;He looked really well when we saw him at the ceremony.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Pompington looked away from a moment, composing herself. She turned back to Chloe. &quot;We went to the hospital last week for an ECG and check-up. The consultant told Reggie he was doing really well. I guess he was wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe took a sip of tea, then asked, &quot;Do you know anyone who want to hurt your husband?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Pompington looked taken aback. &quot;What? Why? Do you think someone did this to him?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe shook her head. &quot;No, no. We&#39;re just trying to understand what happened.&quot;</p>
<p>An uncomfortable silence followed. Chloe expected Mrs Pompington to kick them out of her house. Finally Mrs Pompington leaded forward and whispered, &quot;I think someone killed him,&quot; she glanced around, nervously. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was that horrible woman, Mrs Carmichael. I overheard her threatening him more than once. Horrid woman!&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled at Mrs Pompington while Daniel wrote in his notebook. &quot;Thank you so much for your time,&quot; she said, standing up. &quot;You&#39;ve been so helpful.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Pompington stood up and led the way to the front door. She opened it and smiled as Chloe and Daniel walked out.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, wait,&quot; Mrs Pompington said. She disappeared into the house then returned a moment later. She handed them each a leaflet. &quot;I&#39;m going to be running for mayor. I can&#39;t let that nasty Henry Davenport win!&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel set off down the drive, the heavy wooden door thumping shut behind them. They walked in silence back to the bus stop and sat down in the shelter to wait for the next bus.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe sat in the bus shelter, the wind whipping their hair as they waited for the next bus back to town. Daniel turned to Chloe, his brow furrowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#39;t you ask her about her relationship with the mayor?&quot; he questioned. &quot;That seems like an important detail we&#39;re missing.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe considered his question for a moment. &quot;I could see how upset she was, Daniel,&quot; she explained gently. &quot;Even though she was trying so hard to hide it, the pain was evident in her eyes. I didn&#39;t want to push her too hard, not when she&#39;s clearly grieving.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly, processing her words. &quot;So you think she&#39;s not a suspect then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Chloe replied. &quot;Mrs. Pompington obviously loved her husband. I don&#39;t believe she would have had any reason to hurt him, even if they had their differences.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel tapped his pen against his notebook, deep in thought. &quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But then, why is she already running for mayor? Isn&#39;t that a bit odd?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe followed his gaze to the campaign leaflet Mrs. Pompington had given them. &quot;That is a bit strange,&quot; she admitted. &quot;She must have been planning this for a while, even before Reggie&#39;s death.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s eyes narrowed as he considered the implications. &quot;Do you think she had something to do with it? Maybe she wanted to be mayor all along, and Reggie&#39;s death was...convenient for her?&quot;</p>
<p>The bus rumbled down the road, and Chloe and Daniel stood to board, leaving Daniel&#39;s question unanswered. As they took their seats, Daniel clutched his notebook, his mind already whirring with new theories.</p>
<hr>
<p>The bus stopped in the Market Square. Daniel and Chloe climbed off, pulling their coats around them as the cold winter air met them. After the bus left they headed across the square to one of the grocery stores owner by Henry Davenport. They walked in through the sliding doors and approached the till.</p>
<p>Chloe smiled at the young woman standing behind it. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said. &quot;Is Henry Davenport in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeap,&quot; the woman said, not bothering to look at Chloe, her mobile phone far more interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;Could we speak to him?&quot; Chloe asked, raising her voice.</p>
<p>The woman looked up and sighed. &quot;He&#39;s over there,&quot; she said, pointing in the direction of the back of the store. Her attention immediately returned to her phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Chloe barked, then turned and walked in the direction the woman had pointed.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s rude,&quot; Chloe remarked to Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Daniel responded.</p>
<p>Chloe laughed, Daniel not picking up on the woman&#39;s bad manners amusing her. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she told him, grabbing his arm and pulling him toward the back of the store.</p>
<p>Boxes full of tins surrounded Henry Davenport. He scanned the barcode on one of the boxes with his smartphone. The smartphone pinged and Henry cursed. &quot;Bloody hell, wrong again,&quot; he muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, hello,&quot; Chloe said softly, not wanting to alarm him.</p>
<p>Henry turned to look at them and smiled. &quot;How can I help you?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Chloe smiled apologetically. &quot;Hi, Mr. Davenport. We were hoping to talk to you about what happened at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony the other night. Do you have a few minutes?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry frowned, glancing down at the boxes around him. &quot;I&#39;m a bit tied up at the moment, actually. Inventory issues.&quot; He shook his head in frustration.</p>
<p>Chloe nodded understandingly. &quot;I see. Well, would it be possible for us to come back and speak with you a bit later, perhaps?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Henry paused, considering her request. &quot;Tell you what,&quot; he said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you and your friend meet me at the Driftwood Inn around one o&#39;clock? I can take a break then and we can chat.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s face lit up. &quot;That would be wonderful, thank you. We&#39;ll see you there.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry nodded and turned his attention back to the boxes, effectively dismissing them.</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, placing a hand on his arm. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s head out.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel followed Chloe out of the store, his brow furrowed in thought. As they stepped back out into the cold, he spoke up. &quot;Do you think he&#39;ll actually show up?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe considered the question. &quot;I hope so,&quot; she said. &quot;He seemed a bit annoyed. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel pulled his coat around him and slapped his arms. &quot;It&#39;s freezing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chloe pulled her own coat tighter around herself. &quot;Let&#39;s head to the Driftwood Inn, we can get some lunch while we wait for Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe made their way down the cobblestone streets, the sound of their footsteps echoing against the quaint buildings. The salty air from the nearby harbor mixed with the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread wafting from the local bakery.</p>
<p>As they approached the Driftwood Inn, the warmth and chatter from within beckoned them inside. Stepping through the heavy wooden door, they were greeted by the cozy, inviting atmosphere of the pub. Mismatched furniture and maritime decor gave the space a charming, lived-in feel.</p>
<p>Chloe guided Daniel to a small table near the fireplace, its crackling flames casting a soft glow over the room. They settled into the well-worn chairs, their hands wrapping around the worn menus as they perused the options.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, the shepherd&#39;s pie sounds delicious,&quot; Chloe mused, her eyes scanning the menu.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded in agreement, his own gaze fixed on the options. &quot;And the fish and chips.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, pleased to see Daniel engaging with the menu. &quot;It is. Shall we both get that then?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel returned her smile with a small nod. &quot;Sounds good.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe stood from the table, smoothing her hands over her skirt. &quot;I&#39;ll go order for us. You stay put and warm up by the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>As Chloe made her way to the bar, Daniel took a moment to absorb the cozy atmosphere of the Driftwood Inn. The chatter of the other patrons, the crackle of the fire, and the welcoming scents all combined to create a sense of comfort that Daniel found soothing.</p>
<p>Chloe returned shortly, a tray in her hands bearing two steaming plates of fish and chips, along with two pints of ale. &quot;There we are,&quot; she said, setting the tray down on the table. &quot;Dig in!&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel eagerly picked up his fork, the aroma of the freshly fried fish making his mouth water. Chloe watched him with a fond smile, taking a sip of her own drink as they waited for Henry Davenport to arrive.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe sat by the crackling fireplace, enjoying their steaming plates of fish and chips. As they ate, their conversation was occasionally interrupted by the chatter from a nearby table.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see the mayor collapse?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice reached their ears.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everyone in the town saw it,&quot; the man at the table replied.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe glanced at each other, their curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>&quot;You think someone killed him?&quot; the woman asked, her voice lowered.</p>
<p>The man shook his head. &quot;Naw, everyone knew he had a dodgy heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; the woman said, a hint of uncertainty in her tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Who would kill the mayor?&quot; the man asked, sounding skeptical.</p>
<p>The woman leaned in, her voice taking on a conspiratorial whisper. &quot;The postman.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe both paused, their forks hovering over their plates as they listened intently.</p>
<p>&quot;Benjamin? No way, he couldn&#39;t harm a fly,&quot; the man scoffed.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Tobias,&quot; the woman corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobias?&quot; the man repeated, his brow furrowing.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, remember all that hoo-ah about the park,&quot; the woman said, her eyes darting around the room.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe exchanged a look, their meal forgotten as they processed the overheard conversation. Before they could discuss it further, the sound of the Driftwood Inn&#39;s door opening drew their attention.</p>
<p>Henry Davenport strode into the pub, his expression one of determination. He scanned the room, his gaze settling on Daniel and Chloe&#39;s table. With a purposeful stride, he made his way towards them, his footsteps echoing against the wooden floorboards.</p>
<p>Henry grabbed a chair and pulled it across the wooden floor, the scraping echoing through the pub. He sat down, then signalled to the barman, who started to draw a pint of lager.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what do you want?&quot; Henry asked, barely concealing his irritation.</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, ignoring Henry&#39;s demeanour. &quot;Thank you for agreeing to meet with us Mr. Davenport,&quot; she said, trying to sound as polite as possible.</p>
<p>The barman placed the pint of lager in front of Henry and whispered something in his ear. Henry laughed, and thanked him. Then he turned his attention back to Chloe. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve just had one of those days. You said you had some questions about the mayor&#39;s death.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. &quot;Yes, we do,&quot; she said. &quot;You don&#39;t mind us asking, do you Mr Davenport?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry took a long, hearty swig of his beer and sighed contently. &quot;Yes, that hits the spot,&quot; he said. &quot;Please, call me Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, Henry,&quot; Chloe began, her tone sharp, &quot;You were there when the mayor collapsed?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry nodded. &quot;Yes, I was in crowd, as was everyone else from the village.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you notice anything unusual?&quot; Chloe asked.</p>
<p>Henry shook his head. &quot;If you mean besides the mayor dropping dead in front of everyone, then no,&quot; he said, his tone clipped.</p>
<p>Chloe took a slow sip of her tea, masking her surprise at Henry&#39;s bluntness. &quot;You were involved in setting up the stage, the lights, all the arrangements for the ceremony, right?&quot; she asked, keeping her voice steady.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, irritation flaring in his eyes. &quot;My family’s been responsible for providing the Christmas tree and organising the ceremony for generations.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel write something down in his notebook.</p>
<p>&quot;How well did you know the mayor?&quot; Chloe asked, a flicker of uncertainty creeping into her voice.</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Are you accusing me of something?&quot; His voice was sharper now, edged with defensiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Chloe replied carefully, sensing the tension rising. &quot;We&#39;re just trying to understand what really happened on Thursday night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The mayor had a heart attack,&quot; Henry snapped, his face flushing. &quot;Everyone knows he had a heart condition.&quot;</p>
<p>He grabbed his pint and downed it in one angry gulp. Slamming the empty glass onto the table, he stood up abruptly. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t go around accusing people, young lady. Keep your pretty nose out of things that don’t concern you.&quot; His words were venomous, and without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel and stormed out of the pub, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe left the pub shortly after Henry stormed out. They walked down the cobbled streets to Craft workshop. The sound of machines, laugher and chatter reached them as they opened the door. Chloe noticed that the tension lifted from Daniel&#39;s shoulders as soon as he walked in. A smile replaced the serious expression he&#39;d worn all day.</p>
<p>Daniel took Chloe through to a workbench in the back of the workshop. It stood in a corner, away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the workshop. He pulled up a stood and took out his notebook. Chloe leant against the workshop and waited for Daniel. He flipped through the pages, adding a mark in a few places, and drawing circles around some words.</p>
<p>After scribbling a few final updates in his notebook, Daniel put the pen down and stood up, a sense of purpose building within him. He walked over to the cupboard and retrieved a large sheet of paper and a set of marker pens. Returning to his workbench, he carefully smoothed the paper flat.. Taking a deep breath, he uncapped a black marker and wrote &quot;Mayor Pompington&quot; in bold, precise letters at the center of the page.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment, Daniel spun the marker in his hand, then carefully added &quot;Mrs. Pompington&quot; just to the side of the mayor’s name, connecting the two with a straight line. Methodically, he continued, writing &quot;H. Davenport,&quot; &quot;I. Carmichael,&quot; and &quot;T. Marsh,&quot; each name earning its own place on the paper, each line he drew connecting them to the mayor like threads in a web. He stood back for a moment, eyes scanning the names and lines, as if seeing the puzzle take shape before him.</p>
<p>Daniel silently handed Chloe a marker, his eyes focused on the web of names and connections he had laid out. Chloe took the marker, her fingers brushing against his, and stepped forward to add her own observations.</p>
<p>Next to &quot;Mayor Pompington,&quot; she wrote in her neat cursive, &quot;Collapsed on stage at about 7pm. Declared dead at about 8:30pm.&quot; Stepping back, she studied the diagram, her brow furrowed in concentration.</p>
<p>Chloe then drew a line between &quot;Mrs. Pompington&quot; and &quot;I. Carmichael,&quot; and jotted down, &quot;Mrs P. does not like I.C.&quot; Her lips pursed slightly, hinting at the complexities she was beginning to uncover.</p>
<p>Turning her attention to &quot;H. Davenport,&quot; Chloe added a succinct note above his name: &quot;Not very helpful.&quot; Daniel watched her movements, his eyes flickering with a quiet satisfaction as she made connections he had already begun to see.</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stood back, surveying the completed case board. The web of names and connections sprawled across the large sheet of paper, each line representing a thread in the mystery they were unraveling. Without a word, Daniel leaned in and, with deliberate precision, added a note next to &quot;H. Davenport&quot;: &quot;Inconsistencies in story.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe furrowed her brow as she read the comment. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; she asked, pointing to Daniel’s last addition.</p>
<p>Daniel paused, spinning the marker pen thoughtfully between his fingers. &quot;Henry said his family always provides the Christmas tree for the ceremony,&quot; he said slowly, his eyes fixed on the board. &quot;But that’s not true. The tree comes from the forestry department, from the plantation on the hill.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe raised her eyebrows, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. Daniel’s attention to detail never ceased to impress her. &quot;Good catch,&quot; she said, her voice warm with admiration. &quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his mind turning over the events of that night. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, his voice steady. &quot;Henry claimed he was in the crowd when the mayor collapsed, but he wasn’t. I saw him off to the side, talking with another man.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe’s smile faded slightly, her gaze sharpening as she absorbed this new piece of the puzzle. &quot;So why would he lie about that?&quot; she murmured, more to herself than to Daniel. The tension in the room thickened as they both realized the implications.</p>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Chloe slid into one of the café’s worn wooden chairs, eyeing Maisie as she approached with an exaggerated swagger, hand on her hip like she owned the place. Maisie snapped open her notepad, mimed chewing gum like a rebellious teenager, and drawled, “What’ll it be, sugar?”</p>
<p>Chloe burst out laughing, nearly knocking over the sugar dispenser. “Oh, please,” she said, lightly swatting Maisie’s arm. “We’re supposed to be serious here. Didn’t you say Rosie wanted you to work on your customer service skills?”</p>
<p>Maisie plopped down in the chair beside Chloe, letting out a dramatic sigh. “Yeah, yeah. That, and apparently I’m supposed to learn how to run a business and magically become confident overnight. Sometimes I think I should just get out of this town.”</p>
<p>Chloe reached across the table and squeezed Maisie’s hand, her voice softening. “I get it. But Rosie’s trying to help you, and let’s be honest—running this place hasn’t been easy for her. She’s been here five years, and people still treat her like she’s just passing through. And since you’re the first face everyone sees when they walk in, if things aren’t perfect, it’s Rosie who takes the hit.”</p>
<p>Maisie nodded, her eyes fixed on the table. “I know, and I really like Rosie. I don’t want to let her down. It’s just… I’m not great with people, you know? I’d rather be coding a website or fixing a glitchy program any day.”</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, her tone lightening. “Who says you can’t do both? Think of it this way: dealing with people is just another system to debug. A little trial and error, and you’ll figure it out.”</p>
<p>Maisie snorted. “Yeah, but at least with computers, if they get on your nerves, you can just reboot them.”</p>
<p>“True,” Chloe said, grinning. “But try not to reboot any customers, okay? Rosie might not appreciate that.”</p>
<p>They both laughed, the tension easing as they settled back into their easy, familiar rhythm—friends who had shared everything from school crushes to small-town dreams, and now, maybe, the occasional misguided café customer.</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back in her chair, a mischievous glint in her eye. &quot;Alright, Maisie, let&#39;s practice. I&#39;ll be the customer, you be you.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie groaned but stood up, smoothing her apron. &quot;Fine, but go easy on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a chance,&quot; Chloe grinned. She hunched her shoulders, put on a gruff voice, and waved an imaginary cane. &quot;Oi! You there! I&#39;ve been waiting for my tea for ten minutes!&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie bit her lip, trying not to laugh. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, sir. I&#39;ll get that for you right away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not good enough!&quot; Chloe barked, barely containing her own laughter. &quot;In my day, service was prompt and courteous!&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie struggled to keep a straight face. &quot;Of course, sir. Would you like a complimentary scone while you wait?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe broke character, clapping. &quot;Perfect! See? You&#39;ve got this.&quot;</p>
<p>They went through several more scenarios, each more ridiculous than the last. Chloe pretended to be a fussy mother with triplets, a hipster demanding gluten-free, dairy-free everything, and a tourist who couldn&#39;t understand the menu.</p>
<p>By the time they got to Chloe&#39;s impression of a five-year-old having a meltdown over not getting sprinkles on their hot chocolate, both girls were in stitches.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Maisie gasped, wiping tears from her eyes. &quot;I think I get it now. Kill them with kindness, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, still giggling. &quot;Exactly. And remember, most bad customers are just people are just having a bad day. Your smile might be the only good thing they see.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie&#39;s laughter faded into a genuine smile. &quot;Thanks, Chloe. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably burn down the café,&quot; Chloe teased, ducking as Maisie threw a napkin at her.</p>
<p>Maisie slid into the seat across from Chloe, her brow furrowed with concern. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Chloe asked. &quot;You look like you&#39;ve got something on your mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie leaned forward, her voice low. &quot;I overheard something yesterday, and I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spill,&quot; Chloe said, her eyes widening with curiosity.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, so Isabel Carmichael was in here with a friend from out of town. I was wiping down the table next to them, and I couldn&#39;t help but overhear their conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, urging her to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;The friend asked about the mayor, and Isabel got this weird look on her face. She leaned in close and whispered, &#39;The mayor deserved it.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyebrows shot up. &quot;Deserved what?&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know, but it gets weirder. Isabel started telling her friend that the mayor&#39;s plans would have destroyed the town. She said something about how he was going to ruin everything, and that someone had to stop him.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe sat back in her chair, processing the information. &quot;What do you think she meant by that? What plans?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea,&quot; Maisie said, her fingers tapping nervously on the table. &quot;But the way she said it, it was like she knew something was going to happen to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe chewed on her lower lip, her mind racing. &quot;Do you think she had something to do with his death?&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie shrugged, her face etched with worry. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I mean, Isabel&#39;s always been a bit odd, but I can&#39;t imagine her actually hurting anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still,&quot; Chloe said, leaning forward, &quot;it&#39;s a pretty big coincidence, don&#39;t you think? The mayor dies, and Isabel&#39;s talking about how he deserves it?&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie nodded, her eyes distant. &quot;I just can&#39;t shake the feeling that there&#39;s more to this than we know. Like there&#39;s something bigger going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe reached across the table, placing her hand over Maisie&#39;s. &quot;Hey, whatever it is, we&#39;ll figure it out. Daniel&#39;s on the case, and you know he won&#39;t rest until he gets to the bottom of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie managed a small smile, grateful for Chloe&#39;s reassurance. &quot;You&#39;re right. I just hope we can figure it out before something else happens.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel&#39;s hands moved with practiced precision as he guided the chisel along the spinning table leg, shaping the wood with delicate, fluid motions. The lathe&#39;s steady rhythm provided a soothing backdrop to his focused concentration, and he lost himself in the familiar task.</p>
<p>The sound of approaching footsteps drew his attention, and he glanced up to see George Harrison making his way across the workshop. Daniel slowed the lathe, watching as the older man approached.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel, my boy,&quot; George said, a warm smile spreading across his weathered face. He held out a letter, the envelope slightly crumpled. &quot;Tobias just delivered this for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel accepted the letter, turning it over in his hands. His brow furrowed as he recognized the unfamiliar handwriting on the envelope.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobias said it&#39;s important,&quot; George added, his eyes reflecting a hint of curiosity.</p>
<p>Daniel placed the letter down on the workbench, his fingers tracing the unfamiliar script. &quot;I&#39;ll take a look at it later,&quot; he said, turning his attention back to the lathe.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking of which, let me have a look at that table leg you&#39;ve been working on,&quot; George said, stepping closer to Daniel&#39;s project.</p>
<p>Daniel slowed the lathe, allowing George to examine the smooth, tapered shape of the wood. George ran his calloused fingers over the surface, a look of approval on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Remarkable,&quot; George murmured, his eyes sparkling with admiration. &quot;You have such a natural feel for the wood, Daniel. I&#39;ve never seen anyone take to the lathe quite like you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his lips curving into a small smile at George&#39;s praise. He turned back to the lathe, slowly increasing the speed as he resumed his work. The wood spun steadily, the chisel gliding across the surface with precision.</p>
<p>George watched in silent admiration, his eyes following the graceful movements of Daniel&#39;s hands. The rhythmic sound of the lathe filled the workshop, punctuated by the soft scraping of the chisel against the wood.</p>
<p>After a few moments, George cleared his throat. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll leave you to it, then,&quot; he said, placing a hand on Daniel&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Let me know if you need anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel glanced up briefly, offering a nod of acknowledgment. &quot;Thank you, Mr. Harrison,&quot; he replied, his focus already returning to the task at hand.</p>
<p>George gave Daniel&#39;s shoulder a gentle squeeze before turning and making his way across the workshop. The soft creak of the door signaled his departure, and Daniel was once again left alone with the soothing cadence of the lathe.</p>
<p>As the minutes ticked by, Daniel&#39;s world narrowed to the wood, the tools, and the rhythmic motions of his work. The letter from Tobias lay forgotten on the workbench, its importance momentarily eclipsed by the tranquility of the task before him.</p>
<p>Chloe arrived at the craft workshop, the familiar sound of the lathe drawing her in. As she stepped through the doorway, her eyes immediately landed on Daniel, his focus unwavering as he guided the chisel along the spinning wood.</p>
<p>Quietly, Chloe made her way to the workbench, perching on a stool beside him. She watched, mesmerized, as Daniel&#39;s hands moved with a fluid grace, coaxing the wood into a graceful shape.</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s gaze drifted to the letter resting on the bench, the unfamiliar handwriting catching her eye. Reaching out, she gently picked it up, turning it over in her hands.</p>
<p>The lathe slowed as Daniel paused in his work, examining the piece he had been shaping. He reached for an outside calliper to check the diameter of the wood.</p>
<p>Chloe cleared her throat softly, and Daniel&#39;s head snapped up, his eyes widening in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with a hint of unease. &quot;I didn&#39;t hear you come in.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe gave Daniel a warm smile. &quot;What you doing for lunch?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Daniel pulled a Tupperware dish from his backpack. &quot;Mrs Harding may me lunch,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chloe stood up. &quot;Cool, I&#39;ll just pop out to the shop and buy myself a sandwich then.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe returned from the small shop down the street, a paper-wrapped sandwich in hand.She approached the workbench where Daniel sat, his lunch spread out before him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hiya,&quot; Chloe said, offering Daniel a warm smile as she took the stool next to him. She unwrapped her sandwich and took a bite, relishing the familiar flavors.</p>
<p>Daniel glanced up from his meal, his brow furrowing slightly. &quot;I received a letter from Tobias earlier.&quot; He reached across the bench, sliding the crumpled envelope towards her.</p>
<p>Chloe set down her sandwich, wiping her fingers on a napkin before picking up the letter. Her eyes scanned the unfamiliar handwriting, her expression shifting from curiosity to concern.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a warning,&quot; she murmured, her gaze meeting Daniel&#39;s. &quot;Tobias says you need to stop your investigation into the mayor&#39;s death.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the letter&#39;s warning hanging between them. Chloe&#39;s eyes flicked from the paper to Daniel&#39;s face, searching for any sign of distress.</p>
<p>&quot;You OK?&quot; she asked, her voice soft with concern.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his expression unchanged. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m good.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe paused, realizing she needed to be more precise with her questions. &quot;How does the letter make you feel?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s brow furrowed slightly as he considered her words. &quot;I think it means I&#39;m making progress,&quot; he said, a hint of satisfaction in his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; Chloe pressed, leaning in closer.</p>
<p>&quot;The killer is threatening me, so I must be on the right track,&quot; Daniel explained, his tone matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened, a mix of admiration and worry crossing her face. &quot;You&#39;re not scared?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked at her, genuine confusion in his eyes. &quot;No, should I be?&quot;</p>
<p>A smile slowly spread across Chloe&#39;s face, a blend of affection and pride. She reached out, gently placing her hand on Daniel&#39;s. The warmth of her touch seemed to bridge the gap between their different perspectives, a silent acknowledgment of their unique partnership.</p>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Daniel and Chloe made their way to Rosie&#39;s Café, As they stepped through the door, the familiar scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods enveloped them.</p>
<p>Rosie, the café&#39;s vibrant owner, looked up from behind the counter and immediately recognized her two frequent visitors. A warm smile spread across her face as she hurried around the counter and swept Chloe into a friendly embrace.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe, my dear! It&#39;s so good to see you,&quot; Rosie exclaimed, her green eyes twinkling. She pulled back and studied Chloe&#39;s face for a moment, her expression shifting to one of concern. &quot;How are you doing, love?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe returned Rosie&#39;s smile, her own eyes reflecting a deep appreciation for the older woman&#39;s kindness. &quot;I&#39;m doing well, Rosie. Just, you know, taking things one day at a time.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie nodded understandingly and gave Chloe&#39;s arm a gentle squeeze. &quot;That&#39;s the spirit, my dear.&quot; She then turned her attention to Daniel, who had quietly made his way to an empty table and taken a seat.</p>
<p>&quot;And Daniel,&quot; Rosie said, her voice softening as she approached him. &quot;How are you, love? I heard about the incident at the tree lighting. Terrible business, that.&quot; She placed a hand on his shoulder, her touch gentle and reassuring.</p>
<p>Daniel looked up at Rosie, his expression unreadable. &quot;I&#39;m fine, thank you,&quot; he replied, his voice steady.</p>
<p>Chloe joined Daniel at the table, settling into the chair next to him. Rosie bustled off, returning moments later with two steaming mugs of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you are, dears,&quot; Rosie said, placing the mugs in front of them. &quot;Just the thing to warm you up on a chilly day.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe wrapped her hands around the mug, relishing the comforting heat. &quot;Thank you, Rosie. This is perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie nodded and then, without preamble, pulled out a chair and joined them at the table. Her gaze shifted between Daniel and Chloe, her expression a blend of concern and curiosity.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what&#39;s going on, you two?&quot; she asked, her voice low and conspiratorial. &quot;I&#39;ve been hearing all sorts of rumors about the mayor&#39;s untimely demise.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel glanced at Chloe, a silent exchange passing between them before he turned to Rosie. &quot;We&#39;re...investigating,&quot; he said, his words carefully measured.</p>
<p>Rosie&#39;s eyebrows rose, a spark of excitement in her eyes. &quot;Investigating, you say? Well, you&#39;ve come to the right place. I&#39;ve got ears all over this town, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned in closer, her eyes widening with interest. &quot;Have you heard anything juicy?&quot; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>Rosie&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smile. &quot;Well, funny you should ask.&quot; She glanced around the café, her gaze sweeping across the room to ensure no one was within earshot. Satisfied that they were alone, she leaned in closer, her voice dropping even lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Pompington were not the happy couple they appeared to be,&quot; Rosie confided, her eyes gleaming with the thrill of sharing a well-guarded secret.</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Chloe&#39;s eyebrows shot up in surprise.</p>
<p>Rosie nodded, her curls bouncing with the movement. &quot;Uh huh. They married each other because she had the money that he needed to launch his career in politics. Last year Elizabeth found out that Reggie had been having an affair. She was furious.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s hand flew to her mouth, her eyes widening even further. &quot;My, my,&quot; she murmured, her voice a mix of shock and fascination.</p>
<p>Rosie leaned in even closer, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. &quot;It wasn&#39;t Reggie&#39;s first fling. He&#39;d been in and out of other women&#39;s beds since the day they married. But this time was different. This time Reggie had an affair with an intern. If the news leaked it would be a huge embarrassment.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, who had been quietly listening, his eyes fixed on his hot chocolate, looked up sharply at this revelation. His gaze met Chloe&#39;s, a silent understanding passing between them.</p>
<p>The door to the cafe opened and a couple walked in. Rosie gave Chloe&#39;s hand a squeeze then stood up to go and serve the new customers.</p>
<p>Daniel prodded Chloe in the ribs. &quot;We need to find out more about the mayor and Mrs Pompington.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe left the warmth of Rosie&#39;s Café, the new information about the Pompingtons weighing heavily on their minds. As they made their way across the bustling town square, a familiar voice called out to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe! Daniel!&quot;</p>
<p>They turned to see Henry Davenport striding towards them, his expression a mix of concern and something else – was it guilt?</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Davenport,&quot; Chloe greeted him politely, Daniel nodding in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s gaze darted around the square, as if afraid of being overheard. &quot;Sorry I was so rude in the pub,&quot; he said. &quot;I remembered afterwards that I may have seen something the other day that could be relevant.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s attention sharpened, his mind already cataloging the details. &quot;What did you see, Mr. Davenport?&quot;</p>
<p>The older man hesitated, then leaned in closer, his voice lowered. &quot;I was walking past the mayor&#39;s office a few days before the ceremony, and I thought I saw... Well, I thought I saw Mrs. Pompington leaving the building. She seemed upset about something.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Elizabeth Pompington? That&#39;s very interesting. Did you happen to notice the time, or anything else that could help us piece this together?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry shook his head, his expression troubled. &quot;I&#39;m afraid not. I just... I thought you should know.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel studied the man&#39;s face, searching for any sign of deception. &quot;Thank you, Mr. Davenport.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry nodded, his gaze shifting between the two of them. &quot;Of course. I hope you can get to the bottom of this. The mayor was a good man, and Seabourne needs to know the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, Henry turned and hurried away, leaving Daniel and Chloe to consider the new revelation.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you believe he’s telling us everything he knows?&quot; Chloe inquired, her forehead creased.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s lips formed a contemplative line. &quot;Not sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Davenport, um... Henry,&quot; Chloe called out.</p>
<p>Henry turned, irritation clear on his face. &quot;What?&quot; he shouted.</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel hurried to him. &quot;Are you aware of what the mayor&#39;s plans were for the town?&quot; Chloe questioned.</p>
<p>Henry appeared hesitant. &quot;Plans for the town?&quot; he echoed.</p>
<p>Chloe affirmed with a nod. &quot;Yes, it seems they upset Isabel Carmichael.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry chuckled. &quot;It doesn’t take much to rattle Izzy,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I think she was disturbed by the gossip that the mayor intended to bring a luxury resort to Seabourne.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe looked perplexed. &quot;Why would that bother her?&quot; she asked. &quot;A luxury resort would benefit the economy, wouldn’t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry shrugged. &quot;No idea, you should ask her.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry started to walk away, but before he could get far, Chloe inquired, &quot;Was the mayor planning to announce it at the Christmas lights ceremony?&quot;</p>
<p>Henry pivoted to face her again. Anger flashed across his features as he stepped closer to Chloe, prompting her to retreat. &quot;Listen here,&quot; he said, &quot;why don&#39;t you just drop this?&quot; With that, he turned and strode across the market square.</p>
<p>Chloe stood in shock, unsure what to make of Henry&#39;s sudden outburst. Daniel stepped forward and said, &quot;That&#39;s odd.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe took a breath to calm her nerves from the confrontation with Henry, then turned to face Daniel. &quot;What&#39;s odd?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Daniel seemed deep in thought for a moment, his brow furrowed in concentration. Then he said, &quot;Why would Mr. Davenport get angry like that? He seemed almost… threatened by the idea of a luxury resort.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe observed as Henry Davenport stormed across the market square, accelerating with the onset of a light drizzle. Twilight had descended upon the town, stretching long shadows over the cobblestones.</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, &quot;Let’s go home.&quot;</p>
<p>She remained patient, aware that Daniel was methodically assembling the information in his usual meticulous manner.</p>
<p>&quot;The mayor&#39;s proposal for a high-end resort,&quot; Daniel muttered. &quot;What could possibly trouble the townsfolk? It should undoubtedly attract more commerce and wealth to Seabourne.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. &quot;We should look into it further.&quot; She glanced around the square, her eyes settling on the colorful storefront of the Seabourne Florist. &quot;And I think I know just the person who might be able to shed some light on that.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel followed her gaze, a flicker of interest kindling within him. &quot;Isabel Carmichael?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, her compassionate nature already contemplating the best way to approach the florist. &quot;Maisie overheard Isabel discussing the mayor&#39;s proposals, and it seems she is not in favor of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Without further delay, Daniel and Chloe hurried across the square, their pace quickening as the rain began to fall more heavily. As they entered the florist, the bell attached to the door chimed.</p>
<p>Isabel glanced up from the floral arrangement she was crafting and greeted Chloe and Daniel with a welcoming expression. She rose and stepped out from behind the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; she inquired, her tone cordial and inviting.</p>
<p>Chloe returned the smile. &quot;Hello Mrs. Carmichael, we were hoping to ask you a few questions about the mayor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Isabel responded. &quot;Please, let&#39;s have a seat.&quot;</p>
<p>She guided Daniel and Chloe to a small table cluttered with publications featuring stunning floral designs. The pair settled into their chairs.</p>
<p>&quot;The water&#39;s just finished boiling,&quot; Isabel mentioned. &quot;Would you care for some tea?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be wonderful,&quot; Chloe replied, then discreetly elbowed Daniel to prompt his response.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank you, Mrs. Carmichael,&quot; he chimed in.</p>
<p>Isabel retreated to a compact kitchen area and began preparing the beverages. &quot;Please, call me Izzy,&quot; she called back to Chloe and Daniel. She reappeared with three steaming mugs and set them on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Much appreciated, Izzy,&quot; Chloe said, once again nudging Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Daniel echoed.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon the disarray,&quot; Isabel apologized. &quot;I&#39;m creating arrangements for a rather particular bride&#39;s wedding. Oh, I don&#39;t believe I caught your names.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, I&#39;m Chloe and this is Daniel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re looking into the mayor&#39;s passing,&quot; Isabel remarked. &quot;The word around town is that it was his troubled heart, what&#39;s your take?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re uncertain,&quot; Chloe admitted. &quot;Daniel believes we observed something that might suggest the mayor was actually killed.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel appeared intrigued. &quot;Oh, how fascinating. Have you identified any potential culprits yet? I bet you have.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. &quot;Yes, we&#39;ve got a few in mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel leaned back, clasping her hands together. &quot;Oh, splendid. I wager I&#39;m among them, aren&#39;t I?&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel&#39;s query caught Chloe off guard. Before she could respond, Isabel continued, &quot;If I&#39;m not, I ought to be. It&#39;s common knowledge that I took issue with the mayor and his outlandish plans for a high-end resort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s precisely what we wanted to discuss,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;We&#39;d like to learn more about these plans.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel sprang up from her seat and strode to the counter. She retrieved a file from a drawer and returned to the table. She handed the folder to Chloe.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, this contains all the information I have on the plans. They would ruin this town,&quot; Isabel said, sounding genuinely distressed at the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Chloe said, briefly glancing at the contents. &quot;We&#39;ll review these later. Could you explain why you believe they&#39;ll devastate the town?&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel nodded. &quot;Of course. The mayor had struck a deal with a luxury resort developer to construct a complex where the lighthouse stands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were they planning to demolish the lighthouse?&quot; Chloe interjected. She adored the lighthouse and the small house at its base that had been converted into a museum.</p>
<p>Isabel shook her head. &quot;No, the lighthouse would stay. The resort would be built around it. According to the plans, free access to the lighthouse would be maintained.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel paused momentarily, gathering her thoughts. &quot;The developer wanted to overhaul the town. They aimed to introduce shops catering to the resort&#39;s clientele. I suspect many of the current shop owners would be forced out.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded in agreement. &quot;Yes, I can see how that would be a concern.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel glanced at a wall clock and stood up. &quot;I apologize if this seems abrupt, but I have numerous bouquets to finish this evening.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe rose and said, &quot;Thank you for your time, Izzy. You&#39;ve been incredibly helpful.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabel smiled. &quot;It&#39;s my pleasure. If there&#39;s anything else I can do to assist, you know where to find me.&quot;</p>
<p>As Chloe and Daniel turned to leave, Isabel quipped from behind them, &quot;If you decide I&#39;m guilty, make sure it&#39;s Inspector Rick who arrests me. I wouldn&#39;t mind him slapping the cuffs on me.&quot;</p>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Chloe entered the craft workshop and saw Daniel seated at a workbench, intently studying the chart they had created. She walked over and sat down across from him. Daniel appeared focused, so Chloe waited for him to acknowledge her presence. After making a few more marks on the paper, he looked up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he greeted.</p>
<p>Chloe politely returned the greeting. &quot;Good morning. You&#39;re up early today.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep. I&#39;ve been thinking about the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe admitted, &quot;I didn&#39;t get much sleep either. I can&#39;t stop thinking about it either.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel pointed to the paper. &quot;So, I think we have four suspects - Henry, Isabel, Tobias, and Mrs. Pompington.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned over to examine the chart and agreed. &quot;Yes, that sounds correct.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel tapped the marker on Isabel&#39;s name. &quot;She wanted the mayor out of the way to stop his plans.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>Daniel moved the marker to Henry&#39;s name. &quot;I believe he was jealous of the mayor&#39;s success and wanted it for himself. Killing the mayor would allow him to run for the office and he&#39;s the most likely candidate to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, concurring with his assessment. &quot;Yes, and he&#39;s not been very helpful.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel huffed. &quot;That means nothing,&quot; he said. He moved the marker onto Mrs. Carmichael&#39;s name. &quot;So, she wanted him out of the way because of an affair he was having with an intern and the potential embarrassment it would cause.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, Daniel moved the marker to Tobias&#39; name. &quot;He has an old grudge with the mayor over the park. We need to find out more about that and we need to interview him.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe retrieved the folder Isabel had given her the previous day. &quot;According to the plans, the park would need to be destroyed to make way for the resort. Tobias raised an objection at one of the planning meetings, but it was overruled.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel added some notes to the paper next to Tobias&#39; name. He stared at the chart for a while. Chloe sensed that something was troubling him.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked him.</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head. &quot;How did they do it?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You thought the communal cup was poisoned,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;We both saw the mayor drink from it at the start of the ceremony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but his wife drank from it too,&quot; Daniel said.</p>
<p>&quot;Could she have slipped the poison in when she drank from it?&quot; Chloe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No, the mayor drank from it first,&quot; Daniel replied, his expression serious. He placed his head in his hands and started to rock back and forth. Chloe watched him, aware that Daniel&#39;s rocking indicated distress. Maybe this investigation was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Daniel suddenly stood up, his face lit up with excitement. Chloe laughed as she imagined him putting a finger in the air and saying &#39;Eureka.&quot; Instead Daniel announced, &quot;The glass of water. He drank from it after his speech.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. &quot;And no-one else drank from it.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;And it fell to the floor when he collapsed.&quot; He added notes to the paper, obviously excited with this new discovery.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chloe pointed to the warning letter on the table. “This proves Tobias is the murderer, doesn’t it? He delivered it.”</p>
<p>Daniel picked up the letter and read it again, his eyes narrowing as he examined each word. With careful precision, he folded it back into the envelope and pinned it to the board beside Tobias’ name.</p>
<p>“So, am I right?” Chloe asked, her impatience bubbling over.</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head slowly. “No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. “Why not?”</p>
<p>Daniel paused, gathering his thoughts. “Tobias delivered the letter, but he didn’t write it.”</p>
<p>Chloe felt a flicker of frustration but kept her voice calm. “Daniel, what makes you so sure Tobias didn’t write it?”</p>
<p>“The wording,” Daniel said, tapping the letter thoughtfully. “It’s too formal, too calculated. Tobias isn’t one for polished language or subtle threats. This reads like someone who’s used to being in control—someone like Henry Davenport or Isabel Carmichael.”</p>
<p>Chloe frowned, considering Daniel’s point. “Isabel? But she’s a businesswoman, not a politician. Could she be as likely as Davenport?”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly. “Isabel made it clear she didn’t like the mayor. She was vocal about how his plans would ruin the town’s character and hurt her business. The letter mentions the town’s future being decided, which ties directly into the mayor’s initiative—an initiative Isabel was strongly against.”</p>
<p>“But Henry Davenport has more to gain,” Chloe argued. “He’s been after the mayor’s job for years. The letter’s tone could easily be his—he’s always been formal, almost too proper.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” Daniel conceded. “Henry has the political motive and the desire to see his rival gone. But Isabel’s resentment runs deep too. She’s not just thinking about her business; she’s thinking about the town’s entire future. Remember what she said about how the luxury resort would push out small businesses like hers? She sees herself as a defender of Seabourne’s identity.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded slowly. “So Isabel could have written the letter to protect what she loves about the town.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Daniel said. He uncapped a pen and wrote beside the letter. “Look at the last line: ‘The town’s future will be decided with or without your meddling.’ That’s not just a threat—it’s a direct reference to the mayor’s plans for Seabourne. Whoever wrote this letter isn’t just interested in the position of mayor; they’re invested in what happens next. That makes Isabel just as likely as Henry.”</p>
<p>Chloe chewed her lip, the pieces starting to align. “So do we rule out Tobias?”</p>
<p>“Not completely,” Daniel replied, shaking his head. “His motive still ties back to the mayor’s plans, and he could have been manipulated into delivering the letter to throw us off. But right now, Isabel and Henry are more likely.”</p>
<p>“And Mrs. Pompington?” Chloe asked, thinking of the mayor’s wife and her personal vendetta.</p>
<p>“Her motive is different,” Daniel mused, leaning back in his chair. “More personal, but we can’t rule her out either. Maybe there’s something we’re missing about her connection to the mayor’s plans. She didn’t waste any time stepping up to take his place. Maybe she wanted control over the town’s future too.”</p>
<p>“So Isabel, Henry, and Mrs. Pompington are our top suspects,” Chloe summarized, her mind whirling with possibilities.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his eyes sharp with determination. “Exactly. We keep digging until we find out which one of them sent this letter—and which one of them killed the mayor.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>Chloe pounded on Daniel’s door, not waiting for a response before she burst in. Daniel spun around, startled by her sudden entrance.</p>
<p>“Chloe, you can’t just—” Daniel began, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>“I know, I know, I’m sorry,” Chloe interrupted, her voice tight with urgency. “But this is serious. Maisie’s gone. She didn’t go home last night, and she didn’t open the café this morning. Rosie called me, she’s freaking out.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s expression shifted from surprise to concern. “Okay. Let’s figure this out.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, already heading for the door. “Meet me downstairs,” she called over her shoulder, her voice steadying with purpose as she disappeared from the room.</p>
<p>Daniel descended the stairs, the sound of voices drawing him into the kitchen. He found Chloe leaning against the counter, deep in conversation with Mrs. Harding, who looked unusually anxious.</p>
<p>“...and you know how she’s been lately,” Mrs. Harding was saying, her brow furrowed with concern. “It’s just not like Maisie to vanish without a word.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. She glanced up as Daniel entered the room. “There you are,” she said, her tone a mix of relief and urgency. “Do you think this has anything to do with the Mayor’s murder?”</p>
<p>Daniel considered it, his face thoughtful. “It’s possible,” he said slowly, “but how do we know Maisie hasn’t just run away?”</p>
<p>Chloe shook her head firmly. “Maisie wouldn’t run away, Daniel. She’s got responsibilities—Rosie’s café, for one. She wouldn’t just up and leave without telling anyone.”</p>
<p>Daniel raised an eyebrow, his voice calm but probing. “But Maisie’s always talked about leaving Seabourne, hasn’t she? How she wants to get out, see the world, do something more with her life? Maybe she finally decided to take the plunge.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding sighed, her worry deepening. “Even if she wanted to leave, she wouldn’t do it like this. Not without saying goodbye.”</p>
<p>Chloe looked at Daniel, her eyes filled with concern. “There’s something else going on here. I can feel it.”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly, the weight of the situation sinking in. “Alright. Let’s start by finding out what really happened last night.”</p>
<p>Daniel grabbed his coat from the hook by the door, quickly shrugging it on as Chloe slipped into her jacket. The urgency of the situation hung between them, unspoken but palpable. Without another word, they stepped outside into the crisp morning air, the chill biting at their faces as they made their way down the quiet streets of Seabourne.</p>
<p>The town was just beginning to wake up, the early morning light casting long shadows across the cobblestones. As they walked, Chloe’s pace quickened, her mind racing with worry for Maisie. Daniel, though silent, was equally focused, his sharp eyes scanning their surroundings, taking in every detail.</p>
<p>When they reached Rosie’s Café, the usually cheerful atmosphere felt subdued, the warm lights inside doing little to lift the tension. Rosie herself was behind the counter, her brow furrowed as she nervously rearranged a stack of napkins for the third time. She looked up as Daniel and Chloe entered, relief washing over her face.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank goodness you’re here,” Rosie said, her voice wavering slightly. “I’ve been trying to keep things running, but it’s not the same without Maisie.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, offering a reassuring smile. “We’re going to find her, Rosie. We need to retrace her steps from last night. Can you tell us anything—anyone she talked to or anything unusual?”</p>
<p>Rosie paused, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of her apron. “Maisie was here until closing, like usual. But now that you mention it, she did seem a bit distracted, like something was on her mind. And just before she left, I saw her talking to someone outside. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but...”</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes sharpened. “Who was it?”</p>
<p>Rosie shook her head, her expression troubled. “I didn’t recognize him. He wasn’t from around here, I’m sure of that. They were standing by the lamppost just outside, talking quietly. Maisie looked... tense. Then, she left with him, I think.”</p>
<p>Chloe exchanged a glance with Daniel, the same thought crossing both their minds. This could be the lead they were looking for.</p>
<p>“Can you describe him?” Daniel asked, his tone focused.</p>
<p>Rosie frowned, trying to recall. “He was tall, maybe in his forties? Dark hair, wearing a long coat. That’s all I really remember—sorry, I wasn’t paying much attention.”</p>
<p>Chloe placed a hand on Rosie’s arm, giving it a gentle squeeze. “You’ve been a big help, Rosie. We’ll see what we can find out.”</p>
<p>With that, Daniel and Chloe stepped back outside, the café door closing softly behind them. Chloe’s mind was buzzing with possibilities. “What do you think? Could this guy be connected to the mayor’s murder?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible,” Daniel replied, his gaze distant as he processed the new information. “But we need more. Let’s check around—maybe someone else saw them.”</p>
<p>They began their search, talking to a few locals who might have been around last night. At first, they got little more than shrugs and confused looks. But then, an older man sitting on a bench near the town square perked up when they described the stranger.</p>
<p>“I saw him,” the man said, his voice gravelly with age. “He was with that young girl, Maisie, right? They were talking, but she didn’t look too happy. Seemed like she wanted to leave, but he kept her there.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s expression darkened. “Did you see where they went?”</p>
<p>The man nodded slowly. “They headed down the side street, towards the old mill. It’s pretty deserted over there at night.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s heart sank. The old mill was on the outskirts of town, a place that had been abandoned for years. It wasn’t the kind of place you’d go for a casual chat.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Chloe said, her voice tight with worry as they turned to leave.</p>
<p>As they hurried towards the old mill, Daniel’s mind raced with possibilities. If Maisie had been taken there, she could be in serious danger. And if this stranger was connected to the mayor’s death, they were running out of time to find her.</p>
<p>The old mill stood starkly against the pale morning sky, its crumbling walls and broken windows casting jagged shadows on the ground. The sun had barely risen, and a cool mist clung to the air, giving the scene an unsettling stillness. Daniel and Chloe hurried down the gravel path, their breath visible in the chilly morning air.</p>
<p>“This place feels creepy,” Chloe muttered, glancing around as they approached the mill.</p>
<p>Daniel said nothing, his focus on the heavy wooden door ahead, which hung slightly ajar. Without hesitating, he pushed it open, the rusty hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the mill was quiet and eerily still, the air thick with dust and the scent of damp wood. Chloe flicked on her phone’s flashlight, the beam cutting through the dimness.</p>
<p>“Over there,” Daniel said, his voice tense as he pointed to a figure slumped against the far wall.</p>
<p>It was Maisie. She lay unconscious, her face pale and a dark bruise forming on her temple where she’d been struck. Her clothes were dusty, and she looked as though she’d been lying there for hours. Chloe gasped, rushing to Maisie’s side and dropping to her knees beside her.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, Maisie…” Chloe’s voice was shaky as she gently touched her friend’s shoulder. “Maisie, can you hear me?”</p>
<p>Daniel quickly pulled out his phone and dialed 999. His voice was calm but urgent as he spoke to the operator. “We need an ambulance at the old mill, off Mill Road. It’s an emergency—a young woman is unconscious and injured.”</p>
<p>Maisie stirred slightly, a faint groan escaping her lips as she slowly regained consciousness. Her eyes fluttered open, unfocused and filled with confusion.</p>
<p>“Maisie, it’s Chloe. You’re safe now,” Chloe said softly, brushing a stray lock of hair from Maisie’s face. “Help is on the way.”</p>
<p>Maisie’s lips trembled as she tried to speak. “He… he forced me here… had a knife… said I had to listen… something about the mayor… I tried to get away, but…” Her voice was weak, trailing off as she struggled to stay conscious.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk, Maisie,” Chloe urged, her voice gentle but firm. “Just hold on, okay? The ambulance is almost here.”</p>
<p>The distant wail of sirens broke the morning silence, growing louder as they approached. Daniel stood and moved to the door, waving the paramedics over as they arrived. They rushed into the mill, their faces set in professional determination as they assessed Maisie’s condition.</p>
<p>“We’re taking her to the hospital,” one of the paramedics said to Daniel and Chloe as they carefully lifted Maisie onto the stretcher. “She needs medical attention, but she should be okay.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, her expression a mix of relief and lingering worry. “Thank you. Please, take good care of her.”</p>
<p>The paramedics secured Maisie in the ambulance and closed the doors. The vehicle pulled away, leaving Daniel and Chloe standing outside the mill.</p>
<p>As the ambulance disappeared down the road, Chloe’s face hardened with anger. She clenched her fists at her sides, her voice trembling with rage. “I swear, I’m going to find out who did this to Maisie. And when I do, they’re going to pay.”</p>
<p>Daniel turned to her, his expression serious and resolute. “We will, Chloe. We’ll make sure they do. Whoever’s behind this… we’re going to find them.”</p>
<p>Chloe exhaled sharply, trying to steady herself, but the fury still simmered just beneath the surface. “Maisie didn’t deserve this. She’s just a kid… We can’t let this happen again.”</p>
<p>“We won’t,” Daniel said firmly. “We’ll go over everything we know. There has to be something we’re missing.”</p>
<p>Together, they walked away from the old mill, their steps crunching on the gravel as they left the eerie silence behind.</p>
<hr>
<p>Back at Mrs. Harding’s house, the tension was palpable. The morning’s events had left everyone on edge, and the stakes were higher than ever. Chloe paced the living room, worry for Maisie written all over her face, while Daniel sat at the kitchen table, the folder Isabel Carmichael had given them lying unopened before him. Mrs. Harding quietly observed them from the doorway, her usual calm demeanor masking the concern she felt.</p>
<p>“Chloe, come sit,” Daniel finally said, breaking the silence. His voice was steady, but there was an urgency to it. “We need to go through this folder.”</p>
<p>Chloe stopped pacing and joined him at the table, her eyes locked on the folder. She pulled out a chair and sat down, a mix of apprehension and determination in her expression.</p>
<p>Daniel opened the folder, revealing a stack of papers—maps, contracts, proposals, and handwritten notes, all related to the mayor’s plans for the luxury resort. Chloe leaned in as Daniel spread the documents across the table.</p>
<p>“This is everything Isabel gave us,” Daniel said, his tone focused as he began sifting through the papers. “Let’s see if there’s anything that connects the dots.”</p>
<p>They worked in silence for several minutes, each focusing on different documents. Chloe scanned the proposals and contracts, looking for anything unusual, while Daniel focused on the maps and notes, searching for any details that might have been overlooked. The room was filled with the rustle of papers and the occasional mutter as they exchanged findings.</p>
<p>Then, something caught Chloe’s eye. “Daniel, look at this,” she said, holding up a contract. “It’s a list of contractors the mayor was working with for the resort.”</p>
<p>Daniel leaned closer, his eyes narrowing as he examined the document. “These are all local companies—except this one.” He pointed to a name on the list, <strong>Shadowwater Developments</strong>. “This contractor isn’t local, and I’ve never heard of them before.”</p>
<p>Chloe grabbed her laptop from the counter and brought it over to the table. She quickly typed the name into a search engine, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she looked for information. The results loaded quickly, but something seemed off.</p>
<p>“Shadowwater Developments,” she read aloud. “Based in London… but there’s almost no information on them. No website, no reviews, just a few basic business listings. That’s odd for a company involved in a project this big.”</p>
<p>Daniel frowned, his mind racing. “Try searching for the names of the people involved. Maybe that will tell us something.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded and began typing again, searching for the names listed on the contract. After a few moments, she froze, her eyes widening as she stared at the screen.</p>
<p>“Daniel… look at this.” She turned the laptop so he could see. “The name on this contract, Marcus Deveraux, is linked to several other companies—companies that have all gone bankrupt or been involved in legal disputes over fraudulent activity.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s expression darkened as he processed the information. “So, Shadowwater Developments is a front for something shady. The mayor was dealing with a contractor involved in fraudulent activities… which means this whole resort project could be a cover for something else.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s mind raced. “What if the mayor found out? Maybe he was going to back out of the deal or expose them. That could be why he was killed.”</p>
<p>Just then, Mrs. Harding, who had been quietly listening, spoke up, her voice measured but firm. “Did you say Deveraux?”</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe both looked up, surprised by the intensity in Mrs. Harding’s tone.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Chloe replied, glancing at the financial document in front of her. “Marcus Deveraux is listed as a key figure in Shadowwater Developments. Do you know the name?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding stepped closer, her expression thoughtful. “Deveraux is Mrs. Pompington’s maiden name.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s eyes widened in shock. “Mrs. Pompington? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding nodded slowly. “Absolutely. I’ve known Margaret Pompington for many years, and I remember her talking about her family when we were much younger. Deveraux isn’t a common name, and I’d wager that Marcus Deveraux is a relative—possibly a brother or cousin.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s mind raced as the implications of this new information began to sink in. “So, Mrs. Pompington could be connected to Shadowwater Developments through her family.”</p>
<p>Chloe shook her head in disbelief. “But why would she be involved with a company like that? And why keep it hidden?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding’s gaze was steady as she considered the possibilities. “It’s possible that she brought Shadowwater into the deal through her connections, perhaps hoping to benefit financially from the project. If the Mayor discovered that the company was involved in fraudulent activities, it could have put their entire plan—and her future—in jeopardy.”</p>
<p>Daniel added, “And if the Mayor threatened to expose the corruption, Mrs. Pompington would have had a strong motive to silence him.”</p>
<p>As they processed this, Chloe turned her attention back to the document she was holding. “Wait a minute… look at this.” She pointed to a financial transaction listed in the documents. “There’s a large payment here—transferred to an account under the name Davenport Holdings.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed. “Davenport Holdings… that’s Henry Davenport’s company. Why would Shadowwater Developments be paying him?”</p>
<p>“Maybe Henry wasn’t just involved—he could’ve been the one orchestrating the whole deal,” Chloe suggested, her mind racing. “He brought Shadowwater into the project, knowing they were shady, because he knew he could profit from it. And if the mayor found out and threatened to expose both Henry and Mrs. Pompington…”</p>
<p>“They would both have had reasons to make sure he was silenced,” Daniel finished, his voice grim. “And if Maisie overheard something that connected them to Shadowwater, it would explain why she was targeted.”</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back in her chair and let out a heavy sigh. &quot;Ugh,&quot; she vented, exasperated. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re stuck in a never-ending circle. We haven&#39;t gotten anywhere since we started.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel offered a nonchalant shrug. &quot;We&#39;ve uncovered a lot more than we knew before,&quot; he countered. &quot;It&#39;s just a complicated puzzle that I need to solve.&quot;</p>
<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p>Daniel sat at the kitchen table, surrounded by the scattered remnants of their investigation. Papers were strewn across the wooden surface—notes hastily scribbled, photocopied documents, and pages from the folder Isabel Carmichael had handed them earlier in the day. The overhead light hummed softly, casting a sharp, yellow glow across the mess in front of him. It was late, just after 11 p.m., but Daniel wasn’t tired. Sleep hadn’t even occurred to him.</p>
<p>His focus was absolute. His mind, as usual, moved like clockwork, ticking over each detail of the investigation, slotting facts and clues into place. But tonight, something wasn’t clicking. The puzzle pieces weren’t fitting as neatly as he liked.</p>
<p>He picked up a piece of paper from the table, a contract between the mayor’s office and Shadowwater Developments. The name leapt out at him again: Marcus Deveraux. He stared at it for a few moments, but not because it confused him. He simply didn’t understand why it wasn’t as important as it seemed. The mayor’s connection to this shadowy company, Mrs. Pompington’s maiden name being Deveraux, and Henry Davenport’s involvement through Davenport Holdings—it all felt too obvious. Too easy.</p>
<p>Daniel’s brow furrowed slightly. He wasn’t frustrated, not really, but his mind had become stuck on the same set of questions, cycling through the same details again and again. Was it possible they were missing something? Could the mayor’s death really be as straightforward as a power struggle over the luxury resort, or was there something more at play?</p>
<p>With a slow, deliberate movement, Daniel placed the contract back on the table and reached for his notebook. He opened it to a fresh page, smoothing the paper out with the side of his hand. Writing things down often helped him think. He liked the physicality of it—the way thoughts seemed to solidify once they were on paper.</p>
<p>He began writing in neat, methodical lines:</p>
<p>- <strong>Mayor’s involvement with Shadowwater Developments</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Mrs. Pompington’s connection (maiden name: Deveraux)</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Henry Davenport (financial transactions with Shadowwater)</strong></p>
<p>Daniel paused, tapping the end of the pen lightly against the table. On the surface, the motive seemed simple: a fraudulent company involved in the resort project, threatened by the mayor’s potential exposure of their activities. Mrs. Pompington and Henry Davenport, both with their own stakes in the project, had reasons to protect Shadowwater and their own financial interests. The mayor had likely uncovered something he wasn’t supposed to—hence the motive for murder.</p>
<p>But something about it wasn’t quite right. Daniel knew enough to trust his gut, not in an emotional sense, but in the way he trusted patterns, logic, and evidence. If something didn’t sit right, there was a reason for it.</p>
<p>His eyes scanned the papers again. The same facts stared back at him, but Daniel felt an itch—something beneath the surface. He didn’t know what it was yet, but it was there, and it kept his curiosity ticking over.</p>
<p>He stood, stretching his arms above his head as he walked over to the counter. He filled a glass of water from the tap, sipping it thoughtfully. As he stood in the kitchen, the steady ticking of the clock and the faint buzz of the refrigerator filled the silence, neither sound bothering him. If anything, they were comforting, regular. They fit.</p>
<p>Daniel’s mind returned to the idea that had been taking shape over the past few hours, a new possibility. The mayor’s death, while tied to the resort, might not be the endgame. It was possible that the resort project was a smokescreen, a means to an end rather than the end itself. If that was true, then the motivations of those involved might go deeper than just financial gain.</p>
<p>He set the glass down on the counter and returned to the table, his movements slow and measured. He turned to a page in his notebook where he had listed Shadowwater’s potential interests. Fraud. Construction deals. Shady contracts. But none of those things explained the mayor’s murder in a way that felt complete. It wasn’t just about money—there were plenty of legal ways to make money in Seabourne, especially for someone like Henry Davenport. So why resort to something this drastic?</p>
<p>Daniel picked up his pen again and wrote a single word on the page: <strong>Control</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe the mayor had discovered something larger than a fraudulent contractor. Maybe Shadowwater’s influence stretched further than just the luxury resort. What if the company’s reach extended into other parts of Seabourne—its politics, its businesses? A conspiracy. But not a grand one, not in the way novels or films portrayed conspiracies. This one was practical, functional. Efficient.</p>
<p>The more Daniel thought about it, the more it made sense. Shadowwater’s presence in the resort project might have been the tip of the iceberg. The real question was, what else did they have their hands in? And who else in town might be involved?</p>
<p>Daniel sat back in his chair, his eyes scanning the papers again, but now with fresh perspective. He wasn’t frustrated. He wasn’t anxious. He was curious. His brain, sharp and logical, was moving through the possibilities methodically, piece by piece.</p>
<p>Was Mrs. Pompington protecting more than just her family’s wealth? Was Henry Davenport’s role more than just financial? If Shadowwater’s influence was as deep as Daniel suspected, it could mean that the mayor’s death wasn’t just about the resort at all—it was about something much bigger.</p>
<p>But how did Maisie fit into this? Daniel’s mind drifted to the young girl who had been attacked. Maisie had to know something—something small, perhaps insignificant to most, but crucial to those who needed to keep the truth hidden. His curiosity shifted again. Maisie’s disappearance and attack wasn’t random, and if she had uncovered even a fraction of what they were now beginning to see, it would explain why she’d become a target.</p>
<p>Daniel glanced at the clock. 11:23 p.m. He made a note of the time in his notebook, a habit that helped him track his progress. He wasn’t frustrated. This was all part of the process. He’d continue to dig, continue to turn the evidence over in his mind until everything fit into place.</p>
<p>For now, though, he needed rest—not sleep, just a break, to let the patterns and ideas settle. As he stood, Daniel’s mind remained sharp, turning over the newfound possibilities with a kind of quiet satisfaction. He didn’t know all the answers yet, but he was getting closer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Certainly! Here&#39;s the scene rewritten with the fact that the people of Seabourne don’t know about the resort:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Daniel sat at the table, papers scattered around him, absorbed in his thoughts. Without hesitation, he picked up his phone and dialed Chloe. He needed her perspective on the new ideas that had been forming in his mind.</p>
<p>After a few rings, Chloe’s voice came through, groggy and thick with sleep. “Daniel? What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking,” Daniel said, skipping any pleasantries. “About the mayor’s death. I don’t think it was just about the resort. There’s something bigger going on.”</p>
<p>Chloe was silent for a moment, then let out a sleepy sigh. “Daniel, it’s really late.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he said, not even registering the time. “But listen—what if the mayor’s death wasn’t just about the resort? No one in Seabourne even knew about his plans. He was going to announce them after the Christmas lights were turned on, but he never got the chance.”</p>
<p>Chloe sat up in bed, more awake now. “Okay, I’m listening. Go on.”</p>
<p>“The mayor didn’t just die to keep a resort project secret,” Daniel continued, his voice calm and methodical. “I think Shadowwater Developments is involved in more than just the resort. They’re not just a shady company—they’ve got deeper ties to Seabourne.”</p>
<p>Chloe let out another sigh, but Daniel could tell her interest was piqued. “So, you’re saying the mayor stumbled onto something? More than just the resort?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Daniel replied. “He was planning to announce his secret project, but what if he uncovered something much more dangerous in the process? Maybe Shadowwater Developments wasn’t just interested in the land for a resort. Maybe they were trying to control more—businesses, politics, who knows? The mayor was probably getting too close to exposing them.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s silence on the other end told Daniel she was thinking it over. “No one knew about the resort,” she said slowly. “So, yeah, if he was going to reveal it, he’d have been the only one standing in their way. Maybe that’s why they had to stop him before he could make the announcement.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Daniel said, his thoughts flowing clearly. “And Maisie—she overheard something. Something about Shadowwater that connects Mrs. Pompington and Henry Davenport. That’s why they targeted her.”</p>
<p>Chloe sighed, the weight of the realization hitting her. “Okay, I get it. So, the resort wasn’t the big secret—it was the tip of the iceberg. Shadowwater’s deeper into Seabourne than we thought.”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, even though Chloe couldn’t see him. “That’s what I’m thinking. It’s not just about the land. It’s about power. They were controlling more than just the mayor.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s voice softened as exhaustion crept back in. “It makes sense, Daniel. But look, I need some sleep. Can we talk more in the morning?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Daniel agreed, his focus not wavering. “We’ll pick this up tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Chloe murmured, her voice already drifting off. “Talk to you then.”</p>
<p>Daniel hung up, staring at his notes. His mind was still working through the possibilities, but he knew they were getting closer. There was more to uncover—he could feel it.</p>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<p>Certainly! Here’s the rewritten scene with the correct timeline, reflecting that Maisie was admitted to the hospital on November 20, right after she was attacked at the Old Mill.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The town hall was quiet in the early morning light, with just a few people moving through the hallways, attending to their daily duties. Daniel and Chloe stood outside the mayor’s office, waiting for Mrs. Pompington to arrive. The late November chill clung to the air, seeping into the old building and making the stillness even more pronounced.</p>
<p>Chloe checked her watch. “She should be here soon,” she murmured, glancing toward the entrance.</p>
<p>Daniel, as usual, didn’t seem fazed by the wait. He stood silently, his gaze fixed on the polished wooden door to the mayor’s office. The office that, until a few days ago, had been occupied by Reginald Pompington—Seabourne’s mayor, and now its murder victim.</p>
<p>As they waited, the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall. Evelyn Marsh, the town council member and bakery owner, appeared, walking briskly from the direction of the mayor’s office. She carried a few folders in her hands, her expression calm but businesslike.</p>
<p>Chloe spotted her first. “Evelyn,” she called out.</p>
<p>Evelyn stopped mid-stride, her face barely concealing a flash of surprise. “Chloe. Daniel. What brings you two here this morning?”</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for Mrs. Pompington,” Chloe explained. “She’s letting us look through the mayor’s office. We’re following up on something related to the mayor’s plans for the town.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s grip on the folders tightened ever so slightly, and Daniel caught the subtle shift in her demeanor. “The mayor’s plans?”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, taking a small step forward. “Yes, he was working on something big. We heard it had to do with a new development project. You’re on the council, so we figured you’d know something about it.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Evelyn’s eyes darted to the side, then she composed herself. “I wouldn’t know anything about that. I wasn’t involved in his business. You should ask Mrs. Pompington if you have questions about the mayor’s work.”</p>
<p>Her response was crisp, almost rehearsed. Daniel noticed the tension in her posture, the way she avoided meeting their eyes directly. Something about it didn’t sit right.</p>
<p>“You’ve been on the council for years,” Daniel said, his voice calm but probing. “If the mayor was working on a project as big as we think this is, you must have heard about it.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Like I said, I wasn’t involved in that. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other matters to attend to.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for a response, she turned and continued down the hall, her footsteps echoing sharply behind her.</p>
<p>Chloe watched her go, frowning. “That was odd.”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slightly. “She knows something. She just doesn’t want to talk about it.”</p>
<p>Before they could speculate further, Mrs. Pompington’s arrival drew their attention. Dressed in a stylish winter coat, her posture as immaculate as always, she approached with a brisk step. Her expression was neutral, but her eyes were slightly distant, as if her thoughts were elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Chloe, Daniel,” Mrs. Pompington greeted them with a nod. “Shall we?”</p>
<p>She led them to the mayor’s office and unlocked the door with practiced ease. The office felt untouched since the mayor’s death, with papers still neatly stacked on his desk and a faint scent of his cologne lingering in the air.</p>
<p>Chloe exchanged a glance with Daniel before speaking. “Mrs. Pompington, thank you for letting us in. There’s something else I’ve been meaning to ask.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington arched an eyebrow. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Marcus Deveraux. He’s your brother, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington’s pleasant expression faltered slightly, and she took a step away from the desk, turning her back to them as she looked out the window. “Yes,” she said slowly. “He’s my brother. But we haven’t spoken in years. I have nothing to do with him or the rest of my family.”</p>
<p>Chloe pressed on, her voice careful but insistent. “We’ve come across information that suggests the mayor had a business contract with him. With Shadowwater Developments.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington froze, her hand still resting lightly on the windowsill. Slowly, she turned, her eyes flashing with sudden anger. “My husband? Doing business with Marcus?”</p>
<p>She paused, taking a deep breath, the anger simmering just beneath the surface. “Reginald never told me anything about that. If he was working with Marcus, he kept it from me deliberately. I would never have approved.”</p>
<p>Daniel watched her closely. Her reaction seemed genuine, but there was something in her tone—something that hinted at deeper resentment. Chloe, sensing that the tension had reached its peak, shifted the conversation.</p>
<p>“Would it be alright if we took the mayor’s laptop? We think there may be files on it that could help us understand what he was working on.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington exhaled sharply, her shoulders relaxing a fraction. “Yes. Take it,” she said, waving a hand dismissively. “I want all this business laid to rest. The sooner the better.”</p>
<p>With a nod of thanks, Chloe carefully unplugged the laptop from the desk and slid it into her bag. Mrs. Pompington said nothing more, simply standing by the window, her thoughts clearly elsewhere.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Later that morning, Daniel and Chloe found themselves seated by Maisie’s hospital bed. Maisie, still recovering from her ordeal at the Old Mill the day before, was sitting up but looked tired. Her face had lost the pale hue it had when they first saw her, but the bruises on her temple and arms were still prominent.</p>
<p>“Let me see the laptop,” Maisie said, her voice a bit raspy but laced with determination. Chloe handed it to her, and she immediately began typing, her fingers moving swiftly despite the IV in her arm.</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel watched as Maisie quickly entered a few passwords, each one rejected. After a few minutes, she let out a loud groan. “Oh, come on. His password is ‘Password1234’? Really?”</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow. “That’s... embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Maisie shook her head, a smirk forming as she navigated the laptop’s files. “Okay, we’re in.” Her expression changed as she scrolled through the folders. “Wait a minute... there’s something off here.”</p>
<p>Daniel leaned closer. “What is it?”</p>
<p>Maisie pointed to a folder labeled “Project Documents.” “Look, the files are numbered in sequence, but a few are missing. Like... there’s 001, 002, then it jumps to 006.”</p>
<p>Chloe frowned. “Files were deleted?”</p>
<p>Maisie nodded, her fingers dancing across the keyboard. “I’ll check the logs... Yep. Some files were deleted after the mayor’s death. Whoever did this knew what they were looking for.”</p>
<p>Daniel sat back, his eyes focused but calm. “Someone’s trying to cover their tracks.”</p>
<p>Maisie tapped a few more keys. “I’ll try to recover them, but it’s not going to be easy. Give me some time.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stepped into Rosie’s café, the familiar warmth and scent of freshly baked goods enveloping them. The gentle hum of conversation filled the room, but as soon as Rosie spotted them, she hurried over, her face lighting up in a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, you two,&quot; she said, guiding them to a cosy table by the window, positioned just out of earshot of the other customers. &quot;I’ll bring you both some hot chocolate. Daniel, would you like a chocolate pancake? I’ve just made a fresh batch of batter.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, a small smile crossing his face. &quot;Yes please, Rosie. That sounds great.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie grinned before disappearing into the kitchen. Chloe slid into the chair across from Daniel, watching him as he stared out of the window, his gaze distant. She recognised that look—his mind was turning over everything they’d learned that morning, analysing each piece, slotting them into place like a puzzle.</p>
<p>When Rosie returned, she placed two mugs of steaming hot chocolate on the table, complete with a mountain of whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa powder, followed by a plate of pancakes drizzled with rich chocolate syrup. She pulled out a chair and sat down, her smile fading to a concerned expression.</p>
<p>&quot;How’s Maisie doing?&quot; Rosie asked, her voice soft.</p>
<p>&quot;Much better,&quot; Chloe replied. &quot;The doctors say she’s healing well.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie shook her head slowly, her gaze dropping to the table. &quot;The physical wounds might heal, but it’s the psychological ones that linger. I should’ve never let her leave alone that night.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe reached over, giving Rosie’s hand a reassuring squeeze. &quot;You can’t blame yourself. Maisie’s tough. She’ll get through this.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie nodded, though her worry lingered. &quot;I hope so... God, I still feel like I could have done more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You couldn’t have known,&quot; Chloe said gently, trying to offer comfort.</p>
<p>The table fell into a brief silence, broken unexpectedly by Daniel, who had been quiet until now.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it’s Henry Davenport,&quot; Daniel said, his tone steady, as though he’d come to this conclusion through careful deduction rather than emotion.</p>
<p>Rosie and Chloe turned to him, both surprised by his sudden interjection.</p>
<p>&quot;Why Henry?&quot; Chloe asked, leaning in slightly.</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes shifted back from the window, his voice calm and precise. &quot;We can discount Mrs. Pompington. After today, I don’t believe she lied about her brother or her knowledge of the contract. She was genuinely angry. Tobias can also be ruled out—the letter I received doesn’t match his style. Plus, he didn’t know enough about the mayor’s plans. That leaves Isabel and Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused, letting that sink in, before continuing, &quot;Isabel wouldn’t benefit from killing the mayor. The next mayor is going to carry on where Mr. Pompington left off, and she knows that. Isabel’s too smart to waste time on something like this. Which leaves us with Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe considered this, nodding slowly. &quot;What about the man who attacked Maisie? Couldn’t it have been him?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head with certainty. &quot;No. Poison isn’t his style. If it was him, Mr. Pompington would’ve just... disappeared, or been found in a ditch somewhere. Poison takes calculation, precision—Henry has that.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie’s brows furrowed as she leaned forward in her chair, lowering her voice. &quot;Henry Davenport,&quot; she repeated. &quot;He’s always been a nasty piece of work. I’ve seen more than one of his staff come into the cafe in tears. And he never let go of that grudge about the mayor beating him in the election. Every time I saw him, he was going on about how Pompington stole it from him. He’s never forgiven that.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe’s gaze sharpened. &quot;So, we need to focus on Henry. Investigate his connection to Shadowwater Developments.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded once, thoughtfully. &quot;It’s a place to start. If Henry’s involved with Shadowwater, then the mayor may have found out something that made him a threat.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie glanced between them, her concern deepening. &quot;Be careful, though. If Henry really is behind this, you’ll be dealing with someone who’s used to getting what he wants. And when he doesn’t...&quot; She let the thought hang in the air, her lips tightening.</p>
<p>Chloe squeezed Rosie’s hand again. &quot;We’ll be careful. We just need to dig a little deeper.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, staring out the window, took a slow sip of his hot chocolate.</p>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>The Driftwood Inn was buzzing with the casual hum of afternoon conversations, the clink of cutlery on plates, and the warm, comforting aroma of food wafting through the air. Daniel, Chloe, and Mrs Harding sat by the large bay window that overlooked the harbour, sunlight streaming in and casting soft shadows across their table. The view of the boats bobbing gently in the water was peaceful, a stark contrast to the storm brewing in their investigation.</p>
<p>Daniel sat quietly, his fingers absentmindedly tracing the rim of his glass as his mind worked through the tangled web of suspects and motives. Chloe, seated beside him, glanced between Daniel and Mrs Harding, sensing that their quiet meal might soon be interrupted by the inevitable topic.</p>
<p>Mrs Harding, never one to shy away from difficult subjects, set down her fork and turned to Daniel. Her sharp eyes, a remnant of her once-secret past, studied him closely. &quot;So, Daniel,&quot; she began, her voice light but probing, &quot;how’s the investigation progressing?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, drawn out of his thoughts by her question. His expression, as always, was calm, but Chloe could see the gears turning behind his eyes. &quot;I think it’s Henry Davenport,&quot; he said plainly, as if stating a fact.</p>
<p>Mrs Harding raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh? And what makes you so sure?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned in slightly, sensing that this conversation would delve deep into their current theories. Daniel’s voice was steady, his mind working through each detail in his characteristic, methodical way.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ve been thinking about the mayor’s murder and the people who were around him that night,&quot; Daniel began, his eyes focused on the table as he laid out his reasoning. &quot;Mrs Pompington was on stage with her husband, right next to him when he collapsed. Isabel Carmichael was in the crowd, standing with another woman. But Henry... he said he was in the crowd, but I saw him off to the side, talking to a stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding nodded slowly, absorbing his words. &quot;So you think Henry’s lying about where he was?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;It doesn’t add up. If he was really in the crowd, he wouldn’t have been off to the side, speaking to that man. He’s hiding something.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe listened closely, nodding along as Daniel explained his thought process. Mrs Harding, however, wasn’t finished with her questions.</p>
<p>&quot;And Mrs Pompington?&quot; Mrs Harding asked, her voice carefully neutral. &quot;You’re sure she’s not involved?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Daniel replied, without hesitation. &quot;After meeting her today, I don’t think she lied about her brother or not knowing about the contract. She seemed genuinely upset.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding leaned back in her chair, considering this. &quot;What about Isabel? Could she have had a hand in this?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head. &quot;Isabel’s too smart to gain anything by killing the mayor. Whoever replaces him will continue the resort plans. She knows that. There’s no advantage for her to take such a risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding sipped her tea thoughtfully, then set her cup down with a soft clink. &quot;And Tobias? What’s his alibi?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel paused, his brow furrowing slightly. &quot;I don’t know. I haven’t been able to figure out where Tobias was that night.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, about to speak when a shadow fell across their table. They all turned to see <strong>Arthur Shaw</strong>, the retired fisherman, standing nearby. Arthur was a large man, his face weathered from years at sea, his grey beard neatly trimmed. His thick accent, a mix of local dialect and gruffness, had always been a bit of a challenge for Daniel, who struggled to decipher the older man’s words.</p>
<p>Arthur shuffled closer, his cap in hand. &quot;Ahoy there,&quot; he greeted them in his deep, raspy voice, nodding at Mrs Harding before turning to Daniel and Chloe. &quot;I ’eard ye talkin’ ‘bout Tobias. Aye, I ken where ’e was tha’ night.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel blinked, momentarily thrown by Arthur’s thick accent, while Chloe leaned in, already familiar with how to decode his speech. &quot;You do?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Arthur nodded. &quot;Aye. We were fishin’ off tha’ harbour. ’Im an’ me, jus’ the two of us, out fer a night catch.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, as usual, found himself struggling to piece together the words. He looked over at Chloe, his brow furrowing slightly. &quot;What did he say?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, used to playing translator in these situations. &quot;He said Tobias was with him, fishing off the harbour the night the mayor was killed.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding raised her eyebrows, clearly intrigued. &quot;Fishing, you say?&quot;</p>
<p>Arthur nodded again, his expression serious. &quot;Aye, fer most o’ the night. No way ‘e could’ve been anywhere else. Caught a fine batch, too.&quot; He scratched his beard thoughtfully, then added, &quot;Ye’ll no find Tobias mixed up in this murder business.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe turned back to Daniel. &quot;It sounds like Tobias has an alibi. He was out fishing with Arthur all night.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes flickered with new understanding. &quot;So Tobias wasn’t anywhere near the mayor.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding’s lips curved into a thoughtful smile. &quot;Well, that rules out Tobias, doesn’t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Arthur, satisfied that he’d helped, tipped his cap. &quot;Aye. Thought ye might want t’ know. Tobias’s a good lad. Wouldn’t hurt a fly.&quot; With that, he gave them all a brief nod and shuffled back toward the bar.</p>
<p>Daniel stared after him for a moment, still piecing together the new information. He turned back to Chloe and Mrs Harding, his tone steady and measured. &quot;It’s true that Tobias was with Arthur, but I don’t think the alibis prove much in this case.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding narrowed her eyes. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The poison was in the mayor’s glass of water,&quot; Daniel explained, his fingers tapping lightly on the table. &quot;It could have been put there at any time, long before the mayor actually drank from it on stage. Whoever poisoned him wouldn’t need to be near him when he collapsed. It’s irrelevant where they were when it happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded slowly, her gaze thoughtful. &quot;So, the alibis don’t matter much. They could have set things in motion earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes grew sharper. &quot;Exactly. And even though the alibis don’t clear anyone, all the other evidence still points to Henry. He had a grudge against the mayor, a connection to Shadowwater, and he lied about where he was.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding’s eyes gleamed with understanding. &quot;So, Henry is still our strongest suspect. His alibi being shaky just strengthens your case.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;We need more than just a suspicion, though. We need to prove it.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe glanced out the window at the boats bobbing in the harbour, her mind working through the next steps. &quot;We’re close. We just need that last piece of evidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding gave a small smile, a glint of admiration in her eyes. &quot;You’re on the right track. Just be careful. If Henry’s hiding this much, he won’t go down quietly.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, still calm, sipped his tea.</p>
<hr>
<p>The dining room at Mrs. Harding’s house was quiet except for the steady, rhythmic tapping of Chloe’s fingers on her laptop keyboard. The soft, intermittent sound had grown more noticeable to Daniel, pulling his focus away from the papers he’d been reviewing. He frowned slightly, his gaze shifting from the folder to Chloe, then back again. The tap, tap, tap of the keys continued, a constant, low irritation.</p>
<p>Finally, Daniel stood, pushing his chair back. He walked toward the stairs, seeking a brief escape from the background noise that was beginning to grate on him.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; Chloe’s voice broke the silence. Daniel stopped mid-step, turning to face her but remaining at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>Chloe looked up from her screen, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth. She found Daniel’s literal nature endearing, though she knew it often confused people. &quot;Come here, take a look at this,&quot; she said, motioning to her laptop.</p>
<p>Daniel walked back to the table and stood behind Chloe, leaning forward slightly to peer at the screen. The light from the laptop illuminated her face as she pointed to a section of text on the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the entry for Davenport Enterprises on the Company’s House website,&quot; Chloe began. &quot;There are two directors listed: Henry Davenport and Harvey Denton.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel snorted softly. &quot;That’s clearly a fake name created by Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow, intrigued by his certainty. &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel pointed at the screen, his eyes narrowing slightly as he explained. &quot;It’s a rearrangement of &#39;Henry Davenport&#39; with a few letters missing. And even if you didn’t see that right away, the names sound too similar. It’s too convenient.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe stared at the name again, letting the pieces fall into place in her own mind. &quot;You’re right,&quot; she nodded. &quot;It is obvious now that you mention it.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned back to the screen, tapping a few more keys. &quot;But here’s where it gets more interesting. I ran a search for all the companies with Henry Davenport listed as a director. Only Davenport Enterprises came up. But when I searched for Harvey Denton, I found five more companies under that name. And he’s also listed as a director for a few offshore companies.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed as he processed the information. He stepped closer, his curiosity piqued. &quot;Show me the details.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe opened another tab on her laptop and brought up a list of the companies. Each entry had sparse information, but the pattern was becoming clear. She clicked through the results, showing Daniel how these companies were connected.</p>
<p>&quot;I also went through their financial returns,&quot; Chloe added, her tone steady but filled with purpose. &quot;I think money is being moved between the companies. It ends up at Davenport Enterprises, where it’s used to buy construction goods and equipment.&quot;</p>
<p>She opened a spreadsheet she’d been working on, filled with columns of numbers tracking the money flow between the various companies. Daniel, now sitting beside her, began flipping between the pages, scanning the numbers, his sharp mind clicking through the connections.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, sitting quietly nearby with a cup of tea in hand, had been watching the exchange unfold. She glanced up from her cup, sensing that Daniel was close to uncovering something significant.</p>
<p>Daniel’s fingers drummed lightly against the table as he examined the spreadsheet. The movement of funds was subtle, but to someone like Daniel, the pattern was becoming clearer with each line of numbers. He sat back in his chair, his sharp gaze focused on the screen in front of him.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like Henry is laundering money,&quot; Daniel said, his voice calm but decisive.</p>
<p>Chloe’s lips quirked into a small smile. Coming from Daniel, that was high praise, and she knew she had done well in following the trail. &quot;It seems so. The offshore companies, the back-and-forth between the accounts—it’s all too carefully orchestrated to be legitimate.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, who had been quiet throughout, leaned forward slightly, her eyes glinting with interest. &quot;So, Henry’s not just involved in shady business deals. He’s moving dirty money through these shell companies to cover his tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, turning back to the laptop. &quot;Exactly. The offshore companies are likely a way to hide the origin of the funds. By the time the money reaches Davenport Enterprises, it looks like it’s clean, ready to be used for construction and property deals.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked thoughtful as he leaned forward, scanning through more of the financial returns Chloe had pulled up. &quot;But why? What’s the bigger picture here?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe clicked back to the main spreadsheet, showing how the companies’ transactions were linked. &quot;Henry’s been building up a network of companies to funnel money through for years. My guess is that the mayor found out about it. Maybe he was going to expose the connection between Henry’s construction projects and the money laundering.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding set her teacup down with a soft clink, her expression thoughtful. &quot;That would give Henry a strong motive for murder, wouldn’t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;It would. The mayor was planning to announce the luxury resort after the Christmas lights ceremony. If he had uncovered what Henry was doing, it would have been the perfect opportunity to expose him in front of the entire town.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. &quot;And if Henry knew the mayor was going to reveal something, he’d have to act fast to stop it. That glass of water could have been poisoned long before the mayor even stepped onto the stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding’s voice was calm, but there was a sharpness to it now. &quot;We’ve got a clear trail of evidence here, but it’s all circumstantial. You’ll need something more concrete to pin this on Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;We’re getting closer. But we need to find the missing piece that links Henry directly to the money laundering and the murder.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course! Here&#39;s the rewritten scene where Daniel recalls seeing Mrs. Pompington fill the mayor&#39;s glass with water from her handbag, introducing a bit of uncertainty while Daniel remains convinced that Henry is the key suspect:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding stood up from the table, stretching her arms above her head. &quot;I’m off to bed,&quot; she announced, her voice gentle but firm. &quot;Don’t stay up too late, you two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight, Mrs. Harding,&quot; Chloe replied, glancing up from her laptop. &quot;We won’t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Night,&quot; Daniel echoed, his eyes still fixed on the screen in front of him, absorbed in the details.</p>
<p>Chloe watched him closely, noting how he meticulously processed the information they’d gathered. Each number, file, and name was being carefully sorted in his mind, compartmentalised and analysed. She knew better than to interrupt him when he was like this.</p>
<p>Finally, Daniel leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes. &quot;Let’s think,&quot; he muttered, more to himself than to Chloe. &quot;Work backwards.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood up abruptly and started pacing, his hands moving in front of him as though physically arranging the details in his mind. Chloe stayed quiet, observing him, knowing that this was how Daniel pieced things together.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, OK,&quot; Daniel said as he paced. &quot;After the mayor’s death, someone deleted files from his computer. We don’t know what those files were, but they were important enough for someone to remove them.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned forward slightly, but remained silent, letting him continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the files were deleted, we spoke to Henry Davenport,&quot; Daniel continued, his voice calm and focused. &quot;We told him we were investigating, which could have triggered him to cover his tracks. We also spoke to Mrs. Pompington and Isabel, but Tobias wasn’t in the loop. Though, he might’ve heard we’re looking into the mayor’s death through other people.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, keeping pace with his logic as he worked through the details aloud.</p>
<p>&quot;The mayor collapsed on stage last Thursday,&quot; Daniel said, speaking more quickly now. &quot;Mrs. Pompington was right next to him, Tobias was fishing, Isabel was in the crowd, and Henry was off to the side, talking to that stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused briefly, his hands still moving as though rearranging the timeline. &quot;A week before the mayor collapsed, Henry received a large payment from Marcus Devereaux’s company—the same company involved in the resort project with the mayor.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel stopped pacing and sat down beside Chloe, his expression intense as he stared at the screen. &quot;OK. What if the files deleted from the mayor’s computer had evidence of Henry’s money laundering? That would explain why Henry deleted them. But...&quot; he paused, his brow furrowing slightly, &quot;why kill the mayor?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned forward, her fingers tapping lightly on the table. &quot;Maybe the mayor found out about Henry’s laundering and threatened to report him?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel considered this, nodding slowly. &quot;That fits. If the mayor was going to expose Henry, deleting the files wouldn’t be enough. Henry would still be at risk of being reported. And the Christmas lights ceremony would’ve been the perfect moment for the mayor to go public. Henry had to act fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe’s eyes widened slightly as she connected the dots. &quot;The mayor was going to announce the resort project after the lights were turned on. If he knew about Henry’s illegal activities, he might’ve been planning to expose him during that speech.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, the pieces fitting into place. &quot;That explains why Henry acted when he did. The timing makes sense. But...&quot; he hesitated, something flickering in his mind, &quot;the poisoning... it wasn’t something that could’ve been done in the moment. Whoever did it had to have access to the water beforehand.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe frowned, sensing Daniel’s shift in tone. &quot;But Henry was involved in planning the event, wasn’t he? He could’ve had access to the stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly but then stopped, his expression changing as something clicked. &quot;Wait. Mrs. Pompington. I... I saw her.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow. &quot;Saw her do what?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s his eyes focused inward as he recalled the scene. &quot;I remember... Mrs. Pompington. She filled the mayor’s glass with water, just before he drank it. It wasn’t a jug from the stage... it was from a plastic bottle. She pulled it from her handbag and poured it into his glass.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe sat back, her brow furrowing. &quot;Mrs. Pompington filled the glass? From her handbag?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. &quot;Yes. I’m certain. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but now... it seems strange. Why bring your own bottle when there was already water available on stage?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe bit her lip, her eyes narrowing. &quot;Could she have been involved?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, though he didn’t look entirely convinced. &quot;No. She was right next to him when he collapsed. It wouldn’t make sense for her to poison him in front of the entire town. And... I don’t think she knew about Henry’s money laundering. She seemed genuinely upset when we spoke about Marcus Devereaux.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe tapped her fingers on the table, a wave of uncertainty washing over her. &quot;But it still doesn’t explain why she had her own water.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed, his mind whirring. &quot;It’s possible she didn’t know the water was poisoned. If Henry suspected the mayor was going to expose him, he might have switched the bottle beforehand. Mrs. Pompington could’ve just been following her usual routine, not realising what had happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe considered this, her mind racing. &quot;So, Henry could’ve swapped the bottle earlier in the day, knowing she’d use it to pour the mayor’s water. That would still give him the opportunity to poison the mayor without being near the stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly, his fingers tapping lightly on the table. &quot;That’s what makes sense. Henry was desperate to cover his tracks, and the bottle was the easiest way to get the poison into the mayor’s system without drawing attention.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe sighed, her uncertainty lingering. &quot;But the fact that Mrs. Pompington poured the water complicates things. It leaves room for doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s expression remained steady, though there was a hint of frustration in his voice. &quot;It does, but I still think Henry’s behind it. The money laundering, the payment from Devereaux, the deleted files—it all leads back to him. The water might complicate the method, but Henry had the strongest motive. He had the most to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe gave a small nod, though she was still deep in thought. &quot;We’ll have to keep digging. There’s a lot that still doesn’t add up.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel agreed, but his conviction hadn’t wavered. &quot;Henry’s our man. We just need to find the final piece that links everything together.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe met his gaze, her uncertainty still there but softened by the trust she had in Daniel’s logic. &quot;One step at a time. We’ll figure it out.&quot;</p>
<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p>Daniel woke up late. He’d gone to bed in the early hours of the morning, his mind still buzzing with thoughts about the case, unable to switch off. It wasn’t unusual for him—when something didn’t quite fit, his brain refused to let it go.</p>
<p>He headed downstairs, finding Chloe at the kitchen table with her laptop open, the glow of the screen reflecting off her focused face. Daniel knew she’d gone to bed at the same time as him, but she was always up early. He couldn’t understand how she never seemed to be tired.</p>
<p>Yawning, Daniel helped himself to a bowl of Coco Pops and plopped down into the chair beside Chloe. As he dug into his cereal, he glanced over at her screen. She had a map of the area around the lighthouse open.</p>
<p>&quot;What’s that?&quot; Daniel asked, mid-chew.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, Daniel,&quot; Chloe replied without looking up, waiting for him to return the greeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning,&quot; he said after a pause, not entirely catching the hint as he scooped another spoonful of cereal into his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I’d take a look at the planning application for the new resort,&quot; Chloe explained, still tapping away at her laptop.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, though a part of him felt a twinge of frustration. He should’ve thought of that earlier. Then again, he figured, he would have eventually.</p>
<p>Chloe pointed to a red line on the map. &quot;That’s the boundary of the resort. It’s massive.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel peered at the map. He noticed a scale in the corner and leaned in closer. &quot;Is the image to scale?&quot; he asked, his curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>Chloe checked the zoom on the image. &quot;Yeah, 100%,&quot; she replied. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel stood up and rummaged through one of the kitchen drawers, pulling out a ruler. Sitting back down, he carefully measured the distances on the map. After a moment, he sat back, eyebrows raised. &quot;It’s nearly 100 acres.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe pulled up another map on her screen, this one showing the resort’s proposed layout. &quot;Take a look at this. There’s a huge hotel with a luxury spa, high-end villas—some with private pools—a golf course, a marina near the lighthouse, and even staff quarters. It’s like they could house half the town.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, incredulous. &quot;It’s way over the top. Probably one of the biggest resorts in the UK if they get it built. No wonder Isabel’s worried—it could change the whole town.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, closing the map and opening a PDF document. &quot;This is from an earlier version of the application. Shadowwater Developments and Davenport Enterprises were listed as contractors back then.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel leaned in, scanning the list. &quot;Yeah, these are all the usual suspects you’d expect for a project like this. Big contractors, no surprises.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe then clicked open another file. &quot;This is the most recent version of the application. Shadowwater Developments and Davenport Enterprises have been removed.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed as he read through the updated list. &quot;That’s interesting. If the mayor removed them, that’s a massive motive for Henry.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe flipped through the documents to another page. &quot;The total estimated cost for the resort is over £100 million.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel blinked. &quot;That’s huge. No wonder Henry’s furious about being dropped—he stood to make a fortune from this.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back, satisfied with her findings. &quot;It’s starting to come together. My guess is that Shadowwater Developments and Davenport Enterprises were using the resort to launder money. Maybe the mayor caught on and kicked them out of the project.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly. &quot;It fits, but we’re still missing the final piece.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe opened a new tab on her browser. &quot;There’s something else I found,&quot; she said, pulling up the Company’s House website and typing in the name of a company. The results appeared on the screen. &quot;PANMY Investments,&quot; she said, gesturing to the screen. &quot;Take a look at the directors.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel squinted at the screen, his eyes scanning the names. &quot;Elizabeth Pompington and Evelyn Marsh.&quot; He paused, running his finger down the screen. &quot;And the company was registered just last year.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, then opened the planning application again, navigating to a different section. &quot;PANMY Investments is listed as one of the investors in the resort. They’ve put in £20 million. Where on earth did they get that kind of money?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel stared at the screen, his brow furrowed. &quot;That’s a lot of cash. So now we’ve got Mrs. Pompington and Evelyn Marsh tied up in this too. It makes sense that they’d want to keep this quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe closed her laptop and leaned back in her chair, looking at Daniel. &quot;What do you think it means?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel placed his head in his hands, thinking hard. &quot;I’m not sure,&quot; he muttered. &quot;It could mean Mrs. Pompington had a hand in her husband’s death, or maybe she was working with Henry to get rid of him. But now there’s Evelyn involved as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe shook her head. &quot;I can’t believe Evelyn would be involved in something like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel sat back, his hands still resting against his temples. &quot;Mrs. Harding always says people are capable of anything when the stakes are high enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe stood up, stretching. &quot;I need a break. I’m going to the hospital to see Maisie. Want to come?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, his thoughts still clouded by the new discovery. &quot;Yeah, maybe I should.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stepped off the bus at the hospital and began walking toward the main entrance. The day was surprisingly warm for late November, with the sun casting a golden glow over the hospital grounds. They passed the gift shop and café on their way to the ward, the familiar sounds of hospital life surrounding them.</p>
<p>When they entered Maisie’s ward, they found her propped up in bed, the mayor’s laptop resting on her lap.</p>
<p>Chloe leaned over and kissed Maisie’s forehead. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; she asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Bored,&quot; Maisie replied, rolling her eyes. &quot;There’s nothing to do here. The television’s broken, and the common room is always full.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe chuckled as she sat in the chair next to the bed. &quot;Well, you’re looking a lot better,&quot; she said, relieved to see Maisie in better spirits.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, Daniel,&quot; Maisie said, gesturing toward a couple of chairs stacked in the corner. &quot;Grab one and join us.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel hesitated, uncomfortable in the women’s ward, but eventually went to retrieve a chair, taking his time. He placed it beside Maisie’s bed, positioning himself with his back to the rest of the room.</p>
<p>Maisie tapped the laptop lightly. &quot;Thanks for leaving this with me. I think I would’ve lost my mind without something to keep me occupied.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel leaned forward, his attention sharpening. &quot;Did you find something?&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie nodded, her eyes lighting up. &quot;A few things, actually. Whoever deleted the files didn’t do a very thorough job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or they didn’t have time,&quot; Daniel added.</p>
<p>Maisie clicked on the screen, and Daniel and Chloe moved in to look. &quot;Here,&quot; Maisie said, pointing to an image. &quot;This is a photo of Mrs. Pompington with another man. I ran an image search—it’s Marcus Devereaux. He’s got a record for GBH and drug smuggling. Not exactly who you’d expect to see with Mrs. Pompington, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed. &quot;That’s the man Henry was talking to during the Christmas lights ceremony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Marcus Devereaux is Mrs. Pompington’s brother,&quot; Chloe added, leaning closer to the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and she told us she hadn’t seen him in years, that she didn’t have anything to do with her family,&quot; Daniel interjected, his voice thoughtful.</p>
<p>Maisie clicked to another image. &quot;And here’s the same man, Marcus. I think this was taken in the Driftwood Inn. Unfortunately, you can’t see who he’s with.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel stared at the screen intensely. &quot;He’s with Henry,&quot; he said, without hesitation.</p>
<p>Chloe looked at him, surprised. &quot;How can you tell?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel pointed to a faint reflection in the window. &quot;Look at the reflection. You can see Henry’s outline.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned in closer, squinting at the image. &quot;Oh… you’re right. How did you spot that?&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie smirked and clicked on another image. &quot;This one might be more interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel and Chloe both leaned over to examine the next image. It was a scanned letter with the words: <strong>You’ll pay for what you’ve done.</strong></p>
<p>They exchanged a glance, the same question forming in both their minds. &quot;Any idea who sent this?&quot; Chloe asked.</p>
<p>Maisie shook her head, grinning. &quot;Sorry, no clue. But I do have one more thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She navigated to the mayor’s email inbox and scrolled down. &quot;Here it is,&quot; she said, clicking on a message and opening it.</p>
<p>Daniel leaned in and read aloud:</p>

<p>Chloe stared at the screen, absorbing the words. &quot;Divorce?&quot; she murmured, almost to herself. She looked at Daniel, her mind spinning. &quot;If Mrs. Pompington knew he was planning to file…&quot;</p>
<p>She didn’t need to finish. The implication was clear. They all sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the new information settling over them.</p>
<p>Maisie broke the silence with a light laugh. &quot;Looks like the mayor had a few more secrets than we thought.&quot;</p>
<p>A nurse walked onto the ward and walked over to Daniel and Chloe. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m afraid visiting hours are over. You can come back tonight if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie shook her, &quot;No need, the doctor said I can go home today.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel stood up and returned his chair to the stack, while Chloe gave Maisie a hug. &quot;See you soon,&quot; Chloe said, as she and Daniel left the ward.</p>
<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<p>The discoveries from the morning’s investigation led Daniel and Chloe to <strong>Evie’s Sweets</strong>, the bakery nestled in the town square. The moment they stepped inside, the rich, comforting scent of freshly baked bread and pastries greeted them, along with the familiar warmth of Evelyn Marsh, the shop’s owner.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning! What can I do for you today?&quot; Evelyn called out in her usual sing-song voice, wiping her hands on her apron as she approached the counter.</p>
<p>Chloe returned the smile. She had always liked Evelyn—everyone in Seabourne did. Evelyn had a way of making you feel welcome, as though a visit to the bakery wasn’t just about food, but a small dose of cheer for the day. &quot;Good morning, Evelyn! Could I get a couple of sausage rolls, please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course!&quot; Evelyn chirped, heading to the display case. &quot;With meat or vegan today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Both with meat, thanks,&quot; Chloe replied, glancing at Daniel, who was quietly taking in the surroundings, his eyes briefly flicking to Evelyn before returning to the shelves lined with pastries.</p>
<p>&quot;Righty-o,&quot; Evelyn said, carefully placing two piping-hot sausage rolls into a white paper bag. &quot;Just out of the oven, so be careful with those.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Chloe said, swiping her card to pay. She hesitated for a moment, then leaned in slightly, keeping her voice casual. &quot;Could I ask you a quick question?&quot;</p>
<p>Evelyn raised an eyebrow but smiled politely. &quot;Certainly, what’s on your mind?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe paused, choosing her words carefully. &quot;We heard you and Mrs. Pompington are involved in an investment business together—PANMY Investments. Did you set it up to invest in the mayor’s project?&quot;</p>
<p>The shift in Evelyn’s expression was immediate. The usual cheer faded from her face, replaced by something colder and more guarded. Her hand stilled on the counter, and the lightness in her voice evaporated. &quot;That’s none of your business,&quot; she said, her tone sharper now.</p>
<p>Chloe blinked, surprised by the sudden change, but tried to stay calm. &quot;We’re just trying to understand how—&quot;</p>
<p>Evelyn cut her off, her voice firm. &quot;Like I said, it’s none of your concern. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ve got a business to run.&quot;</p>
<p>The friendly bakery atmosphere seemed to shrink as the tension grew between them. Chloe exchanged a quick glance with Daniel, who had been standing quietly beside her, his brow furrowed slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Chloe said, grabbing the bag from the counter. &quot;Thank you for the sausage rolls.&quot;</p>
<p>With a gentle tug on Daniel’s arm, she led him toward the door. As they stepped outside, the bright, cool air of the square seemed to clear some of the tension lingering in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Have a nice day!&quot; Evelyn called after them, her voice sugary sweet again, but there was no mistaking the warning beneath her words.</p>
<p>Chloe glanced back once, but Evelyn was already behind the counter, busying herself with the next customer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chloe and Daniel sat side by side on a bench in the square, the November sun casting a warm glow over the cobblestones. They ate their sausage rolls in comfortable silence, but Chloe could see Daniel was deep in thought. His brow furrowed, eyes fixed on some distant point as he mulled over the encounter at the bakery.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Daniel leaned forward, his body tensing as though he were about to speak. Then, without warning, he jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Pompington!&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe blinked, startled by the sudden outburst. She followed Daniel’s gaze across the square, her eyes landing on Mrs. Pompington, who was just stepping out of the General Store. What was Daniel thinking? She stood up quickly, watching as Daniel strode purposefully across the square.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Pompington!&quot; he called again, his voice clear and unwavering, which was unusual for him.</p>
<p>Chloe hurried after him, a smile tugging at her lips. This wasn’t like Daniel at all—calling out across the square, marching toward Mrs. Pompington without hesitation. She admired his determination, though it was far outside his comfort zone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington turned, a pleasant smile spreading across her face as she saw them approach. &quot;Daniel, Chloe. So lovely to see you both,&quot; she greeted them warmly, the charm in her voice as polished as ever.</p>
<p>Daniel didn’t waste a moment. &quot;I have a—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It’s lovely to see you too, Mrs. Pompington,&quot; Chloe interjected smoothly, trying to steer the conversation with a bit more grace.</p>
<p>Daniel, oblivious to the interruption, pressed on. &quot;…couple of questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington’s smile didn’t falter. &quot;Certainly, Daniel. Is this about my husband?&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;You have a business with—uh, what’s her name—the lady from the bakery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Evelyn,&quot; Mrs. Pompington offered, still pleasant. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts. &quot;Did you set up the business to invest in the resort project?&quot;</p>
<p>Her smile widened, though there was a flicker of something behind her eyes. &quot;Yes, we did. I discussed it with Evelyn last year, and we both thought it would be a sound investment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, OK,&quot; Daniel murmured, but his mind was already elsewhere. He furrowed his brow, pacing a small circle as if rearranging the pieces in his head.</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Mrs. Pompington, feeling the shift in the air. &quot;If you don’t mind,&quot; she began cautiously, &quot;I have a few questions too.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington’s eyes softened. &quot;Of course, my dear. What would you like to ask?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe hesitated, knowing her next question could stir the pot. &quot;Were you aware that Mr. Pompington was planning to file for divorce?&quot;</p>
<p>A light, almost dismissive laugh escaped Mrs. Pompington’s lips. &quot;Yes, darling, I was aware. We talked about it. It was purely financial—something to protect my assets. My husband discovered some irregularities in the project’s accounts.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, taking it all in. But why hadn’t Mrs. Pompington mentioned this before? It seemed like a rather important detail to omit.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all, dear?&quot; Mrs. Pompington asked, her voice sweet but with an edge of impatience.</p>
<p>&quot;Just one more thing,&quot; Chloe said, steadying herself. &quot;You mentioned you hadn’t seen your brother in years, but we found a photo of the two of you on Mr. Pompington’s laptop.&quot;</p>
<p>A flicker of surprise crossed Mrs. Pompington’s face—brief but telling. She paused, composing herself quickly. &quot;Ah, well, I may have seen him,&quot; she admitted. &quot;My husband asked me to. But really, it’s nothing. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must be off.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Chloe could respond, Mrs. Pompington turned sharply and strode into the General Store, her heels clicking decisively on the pavement.</p>
<p>Chloe watched her go, the unanswered questions swirling in her mind. She glanced over to Daniel, who had retreated to a bench on the other side of the square, his head in his hands, fingers tapping rhythmically against his temples.</p>
<p>She didn’t rush to him. Instead, she let him sit there, knowing he needed time to process the encounter. As she made her way across the square, her footsteps slow and measured, she wondered what thoughts were turning over in Daniel’s mind. Whatever they were, Mrs. Pompington had certainly added another layer of intrigue to their investigation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel shook his head, still frowning as Chloe sat beside him on the bench. His brow was furrowed in that way he did when something just didn’t quite add up.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t get it,&quot; he muttered, staring ahead, deep in thought.</p>
<p>Chloe, seeing his confusion, couldn’t help but smile. She knew exactly what it was. Daniel always got stuck when it came to anything involving human emotion or motivation. &quot;What’s the problem?&quot; she asked, leaning in. &quot;Maybe I can help.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused, mulling it over, then finally spoke. &quot;Why was the bakery lady—Evelyn—so upset when we asked about the business, but Mrs. Pompington wasn’t bothered at all?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe considered it for a moment. &quot;Well, Mrs. Pompington’s always had money. There’s no shame in it for her. But Evelyn... she grew up without much, didn’t she? Maybe she’s a bit embarrassed about suddenly being well-off. Could be she doesn’t want people to think she’s changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly, though he still seemed unconvinced.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a booming voice echoed across the square. &quot;Oi, you two!&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe looked up to see Tobias making his way toward them, his stride just a bit too energetic for someone on such a simple mission. He was beaming, as usual, eyes twinkling with mischief, like a man who’d just played a prank and was itching to tell someone about it. Chloe sighed inwardly, bracing herself. <strong>What now?</strong></p>
<p>Tobias stopped right in front of them, hands on his hips, his belly shaking slightly with excitement. &quot;I hear you’ve been poking around about the mayor’s death, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe exchanged a glance with Daniel, who raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Chloe said carefully, &quot;we’ve been asking a few questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Tobias’s grin widened, his whole face lighting up like it was the best gossip he’d heard all week. He rocked back on his heels. &quot;Well, then. I’ve got something you’ll want to hear, don’t I?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel perked up, looking at Tobias with cautious interest, while Chloe waited for whatever ridiculous thing he was about to drop on them.</p>
<p>Tobias leaned in dramatically, lowering his voice as though he was about to share the town’s best-kept secret. &quot;About a week before the lights were turned on, I delivered a... <strong>suspicious parcel</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused, looking at them both expectantly, his grin even wider now.</p>
<p>Chloe blinked. &quot;And?&quot; she prompted, making a circular motion with her hand to encourage him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Right, right,&quot; Tobias said, snapping his fingers as though he’d forgotten the juiciest part. &quot;Aye, it was from a chemical company, wasn’t it? Strange label on it and everything. Delivered it... to the bakery.&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded to himself as if satisfied he’d done his part, gave a little salute, and turned on his heel, strolling away with a jaunty bounce in his step.</p>
<p>Chloe stared after him, completely dumbfounded. &quot;Wait—what? The bakery?&quot;</p>
<p>Tobias waved over his shoulder without looking back. &quot;That’s what I said, love! Bakery!&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe let out a long sigh, exchanging a glance with Daniel, who, in his usual fashion, was already lost in thought, dissecting every detail of the encounter.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re going to need to get more out of him later,&quot; Chloe muttered, shaking her head.</p>
<hr>
<p>The conversation in the square had left them with more questions than answers. Daniel, who had been quietly processing everything, stood up suddenly.</p>
<p>“We need to go to the lighthouse,” he said, matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Chloe blinked, caught off guard. “The lighthouse? Why?”</p>
<p>Daniel didn’t answer right away, his focus already shifting inward, the wheels in his mind turning. Chloe had seen this enough times to know when to follow his lead. Without waiting for further explanation, she grabbed her bag and stood up.</p>
<p>They caught the bus to the coastline, the brisk November wind picking up as they left the centre of Seabourne behind. The ride was short but gave Chloe a moment to reflect on the conversation they’d just had with Tobias and the gnawing sense that they were missing something crucial. The sight of the lighthouse growing larger in the distance brought her back to the present.</p>
<p>The path up to the lighthouse was steep, winding its way past scrubby patches of grass and wild heath. As they approached the base, Daniel quickened his pace, already intent on reaching the top.</p>
<p>Chloe followed him up the narrow, spiralling staircase inside the lighthouse. Their footsteps echoed against the stone walls, and with each step, the cool, salty air seemed to grow crisper. Daniel didn’t stop once. His mind was already set on something, and Chloe’s curiosity grew with every flight.</p>
<p>When they finally reached the gallery deck, Chloe stepped out onto the open platform, the wind instantly tugging at her coat. She took in the view before her, eyes widening as the vastness of the resort&#39;s construction site came into full view. From this height, the extent of the development was impossible to ignore. The cleared fields stretched out farther than she had imagined, dotted with markers for future buildings, golf courses, and even the planned marina near the shoreline.</p>
<p>“Wow…” she muttered, almost to herself. “It’s enormous. They’re going to take over the entire coast.”</p>
<p>The scale of the project was shocking. She’d heard about the plans, of course, but seeing it all laid out like this made the whole thing seem much more real. The quaint village feel of Seabourne was disappearing under the sprawl of luxury development.</p>
<p>But Daniel wasn’t looking at the resort.</p>
<p>Chloe turned to see him standing at the far edge of the gallery deck, his gaze fixed on something in the distance. She followed his line of sight and saw the <strong>old abandoned farmhouse</strong>, tucked away near a patch of wild heathland. It was barely noticeable, weathered and overgrown, a forgotten piece of land that had been swallowed by the plans for the resort.</p>
<p>“Daniel?” she asked, stepping up beside him.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen that farmhouse before,” he said, more to himself than to her.</p>
<p>Chloe frowned. “Where?”</p>
<p>“In the photo. The one on the mayor’s laptop—Mrs. Pompington with her brother. The farmhouse was in the background.”</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at the farmhouse again. It looked insignificant at first, but if Daniel had spotted it in the photo, it must have some importance. Still, she didn’t press him further. He’d make the connection when he was ready. Instead, she shifted her gaze back to the sprawling construction below.</p>
<p>“So, what do you think about our suspects?” Chloe asked, hoping to bring them back to their current problem. “We’ve got to focus on someone.”</p>
<p>Daniel stayed quiet for a moment, his eyes still on the farmhouse before he turned back to her. “Mrs. Pompington doesn’t make sense as the killer. She knew about the divorce—there wasn’t any animosity there. And she didn’t seem overly concerned about the investment business.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. “Yeah, she seemed pretty calm about everything. I don’t think she had any reason to kill him over money.”</p>
<p>“What about Evelyn?” Daniel asked, crossing his arms as he leaned against the railing.</p>
<p>“She was rattled when we asked about the business,” Chloe replied. “Maybe she’s involved in something she doesn’t want to admit. But murder? I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>Daniel tapped his fingers on the metal railing, thinking. “She could be embarrassed about the money, but that doesn’t explain why the cyanide was delivered to her bakery.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s brow furrowed. “Exactly. If the cyanide was delivered to her bakery, she had access to it. But why would Evelyn kill the mayor? What would she gain?”</p>
<p>Daniel tilted his head. “Maybe she didn’t know what was in the package. Think about it—Henry could’ve had the cyanide delivered to the bakery to throw us off. It’s clever, really. If anyone investigates, it points to Evelyn, not him.”</p>
<p>Chloe considered that for a moment. “You think Henry used Evelyn?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible. They’re both involved in the resort, so it wouldn’t have seemed odd to her. He could’ve told her it was something related to the business, and she wouldn’t have questioned it. But Henry’s the one with the motive. He lost the contract for the resort, and he’s still bitter about losing the election to the mayor.”</p>
<p>Chloe looked back at the vast development site. “So, he gets the cyanide delivered to the bakery, but he’s the one who uses it?”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly. “That’s the theory. He didn’t want to risk having it delivered to his own address, so he used Evelyn’s bakery as a cover. But we don’t know if Evelyn’s in on it, or if she’s just a pawn in his plan.”</p>
<p>Chloe leaned on the railing, her eyes scanning the landscape below. “But we still don’t know how Henry could’ve slipped the cyanide into the mayor’s drink. He wasn’t anywhere near the stage when the mayor collapsed.”</p>
<p>“That’s the part I haven’t worked out yet,” Daniel admitted. “But Henry has the motive, and now we know he had access to the cyanide.”</p>
<p>Chloe turned to him, the wind pulling at her hair. “So, we focus on Henry.”</p>
<p>Daniel straightened up, his fingers no longer tapping. “Yes. If we can prove he used Evelyn to get the cyanide, we’ll have our answer. We just need to figure out how he did it.”</p>
<p>They both stood in silence for a moment, looking out at the vastness of the land and the town they called home, the wind howling gently around them. They were getting closer, but the pieces weren’t all there yet.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stepped off the bus in the market square, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the cobbled streets. They started the familiar walk back toward Mrs. Harding’s house when a voice called out from behind them.</p>
<p>“Daniel! Chloe!”</p>
<p>They turned to see <strong>Evelyn</strong> hurrying toward them from her bakery, a little out of breath. She caught up to them, her expression more apologetic than before.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry about earlier,” she said, brushing a stray hair out of her face. “You really caught me off guard, that’s all. I didn’t think anyone would find out about the investment company.”</p>
<p>Chloe offered her a warm smile, reaching out to give Evelyn’s arm a reassuring pat. “It’s okay, Evelyn. We’re just trying to piece everything together.”</p>
<p>Evelyn, still looking a little flustered, handed Chloe a small box of <strong>freshly baked donuts</strong>. “Here, take these as a little apology. I felt awful about the way I reacted.”</p>
<p>Chloe glanced at Daniel, noticing his subtle yet unmistakable energy—he was almost bouncing on his toes, clearly agitated about something. “What is it, Daniel?” she asked gently.</p>
<p>He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his eyes fixed on the pavement. “What was in the package?” he asked quietly.</p>
<p>Evelyn’s brow furrowed for a second, but then she smiled kindly. “What package, love?”</p>
<p>Daniel kept his gaze down, shuffling his feet again. “The one from the chemical company. The suspicious one.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s face lit up in recognition, and she chuckled. “Oh, that! It was just <strong>xanthan gum</strong>. Daphne asked if I could try making her some gluten-free bread. Can’t say I’ve had much luck with it yet, though.”</p>
<p>Chloe leaned in, her tone calm but curious. “Just xanthan gum? Nothing else in the package?”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s smile faded slightly as she shook her head. “Nope, just a bottle of xanthan gum. Why, though? What’s this about?”</p>
<p>Chloe hesitated for a moment, choosing her words carefully. “Tobias mentioned that he’d delivered you a package from a chemical company. We wondered if it might have been something more... dangerous.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s eyes widened, a flicker of surprise crossing her face. “Dangerous? You don’t think—” she paused, lowering her voice, “—you don’t think I had anything to do with the mayor’s death, do you?”</p>
<p>Chloe shook her head quickly, feeling a little guilty for even suggesting it. “No, no, we didn’t think that at all. We thought someone might have used your bakery to get hold of something like cyanide.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s expression softened with relief. “Goodness, no! I wouldn’t let anything like that happen here. It was just xanthan gum, I promise. Honestly, I’ve been so caught up trying to make this gluten-free bread work, I’ve barely had time for anything else.” She glanced at her watch. “Speaking of which, I really have to run—I’m going to miss my bus.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, accepting the box of donuts with a grateful smile. “Thank you for these, Evelyn.”</p>
<p>Evelyn smiled warmly, giving them a quick wave as she hurried off toward the bus stop. “It’s a pleasure, love! Take care.”</p>
<p>Chloe watched her go, turning back to Daniel, who had gone quiet again. He stood there, his eyes on the ground, deep in thought.</p>
<p>“So, that’s a dead end,” Chloe said, more to herself than to him. “It was just baking supplies after all.”</p>
<p>Daniel shuffled his feet once more, looking up at her, his expression focused. “Tomorrow,” he said, his voice calm but determined, “we go to the farmhouse.”</p>
<hr>
<p>When Chloe walked into the kitchen the following morning, she found Mrs. Harding already at the table, sipping her coffee and flipping through the local newspaper. The kitchen was quiet, the soft hum of the fridge the only sound. Chloe made herself a cup of coffee and grabbed a bowl of cereal before settling into the chair opposite Mrs. Harding.</p>
<p>“Morning, Mrs. Harding,” Chloe said with a small smile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding folded the newspaper neatly and set it aside. “Morning, Chloe. How’s the investigation coming along?”</p>
<p>Chloe stirred her cereal, her shoulders sagging a little. “It feels like we’re running in circles. Every time we think we’re onto something, something else comes up that throws us off.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding gave a knowing nod, her eyes twinkling. “That’s the way these things tend to go, I’m afraid. Nothing ever stays simple.”</p>
<p>Chloe sighed and toyed with her spoon. “I’m starting to worry about Daniel.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding raised an eyebrow. “Why’s that?”</p>
<p>Chloe thought for a moment, then spoke softly. “He’s really throwing himself into this, more than usual. He’s barely sleeping. I can see how tired he is.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding rested her hand gently on Chloe’s, her expression calm but thoughtful. “I had a feeling he might get a bit too absorbed in this.”</p>
<p>Chloe looked up, concerned. “Do you think we should stop? I mean, before it gets too much for him?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding shook her head, her gaze steady. “It’s too late to turn back now. Best thing you can do is help him see it through. Once it’s solved, he’ll be able to let it go.”</p>
<p>Chloe stared down at her cereal for a moment, her spoon tapping lightly against the side of the bowl. “But... what if we can’t solve it?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>“We’ll deal with that if it comes to it,” Mrs. Harding replied, her tone practical but warm. She glanced up as a soft creak sounded from the room above. “Sounds like he’s up. What’s the plan for today?”</p>
<p>“Daniel wants to check out an abandoned farmhouse on the land where the resort’s going to be built,” Chloe said, taking a sip of her coffee.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding frowned, curious. “An old farmhouse? Why there?”</p>
<p>Chloe shrugged. “He spotted it in the background of one of the photos we found on the mayor’s laptop. He thinks it might be important.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the kitchen door swung open, and Daniel appeared, stretching and yawning, his hair slightly tousled. Without a word, he made his way to the counter, poured himself a bowl of Coco Pops, and set a mug of coffee next to it. He sat down at the table, focusing entirely on his breakfast, seemingly unaware of Chloe and Mrs Harding.</p>
<p>Chloe exchanged a brief glance with Mrs. Harding, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Well,” Mrs. Harding said, breaking the quiet, “sounds like today’s going to be interesting.”</p>
<hr>
<p>After Daniel finished his breakfast he placed his bowl and cup into the dishwasher then marched out of the kitchen. Chloe and Mrs Harding smiled at each in amusement as they listened to him stomp up the stairs.</p>
<p>Moments later he returned, dressed appropriately for a long hike. &quot;Come on, Chloe,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s get going.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe looked up at Daniel and smiled, &quot;Good morning, Daniel,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning,&quot; Daniel said, impatience evident in his tone.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s barely light out, Daniel,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;Let&#39;s give it half an hour before we set off.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged, walked into the kitchen and sat down with a &#39;Hmpff.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding snickered. &quot;Are you going take off your coat, Daniel?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Daniel stood and removed his coat then carefully placed it on the back of the chair. &quot;We&#39;ll miss the bus,&quot; he muttered.</p>
<p>Chloe touched his arm. &quot;There&#39;ll be another in half an hour,&quot; she said. &quot;What are you hoping to find at the farmhouse?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Hopefully something that&#39;ll explain why Mrs Pompington and Marcus Devereaux meet there.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding leaned forward. &quot;Elizabeth and Marcus met up?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his earlier impatience to catch the bus replaced by eagerness to discuss the investigation. &quot;Yes, we found a photo of them together.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding frowned, looking concerned. &quot;Elizabeth swore she&#39;d never have anything else to do with her family,&quot; she said. The way she said it suggested something else to the story.</p>
<p>Chloe picked up on the tension is Mrs Harding&#39;s voice. &quot;Mrs Pompington told us she&#39;d had nothing to do with her family for years,&quot; she said. &quot;But then we found the photo.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Harding glanced up at the clock on the wall. &quot;Oh dear, I really must be going,&quot; she said, then stood up and hurried out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&quot;Odd,&quot; Daniel said.</p>
<p>Chloe looked over at Daniel. &quot;What&#39;s odd?&quot; she asked,</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head. &quot;Mrs Harding doesn&#39;t work on Fridays.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe looked at the kitchen door, wondering why Mrs Harding was suddenly is such a rush.</p>
<hr>
<p>After Daniel finished his breakfast, he methodically placed his bowl and cup into the dishwasher, then marched out of the kitchen with a sense of purpose. Chloe and Mrs. Harding exchanged amused smiles as they listened to his heavy footsteps stomp up the stairs.</p>
<p>Moments later, Daniel reappeared, now dressed for what looked like a trek through the wilderness. “Come on, Chloe,” he said, his tone brisk. “Let’s get going.”</p>
<p>Chloe glanced up at him with a faint smile. “Good morning, Daniel,” she said pointedly, her voice teasing.</p>
<p>“Morning,” Daniel replied, though his tone made it clear he wasn’t interested in pleasantries at the moment.</p>
<p>“It’s barely light out,” Chloe added, glancing out the window at the pale dawn. “Let’s give it half an hour before we head out.”</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged, letting out a quiet grunt of frustration, before walking back into the kitchen and dropping into a chair with a resigned “hmph.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding snickered, glancing over her coffee. “You might want to take off your coat, Daniel. You’ll get too warm.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Daniel stood, carefully removing his coat and draping it over the back of the chair. He sat back down, but his leg bounced slightly with impatience. “We’ll miss the bus.”</p>
<p>Chloe reached over and touched his arm gently. “There’ll be another one in half an hour. What exactly are you hoping to find at the farmhouse?”</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged again, his mind clearly elsewhere. “I don’t know. Something. Maybe something that explains why Mrs. Pompington and Marcus Devereaux met there.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, who had been quietly listening, suddenly leaned forward, her expression sharpening. “Elizabeth and Marcus met up?” she asked, her tone calm, but with a slight edge that hadn’t been there before.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, his earlier urgency to leave momentarily forgotten. “Yes, we found a photo of them together.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding’s brow furrowed, and for a moment, something unreadable flickered across her face. “Elizabeth swore she’d never have anything to do with her family again,” she murmured, almost to herself. There was a weight to her words, a sense that there was more behind them than she was saying.</p>
<p>Chloe’s gaze flickered between Mrs. Harding and Daniel, sensing a shift in the conversation. “She told us the same,” Chloe added. “She said she’d been distant from her family for years, but... the photo says otherwise.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding’s fingers tightened slightly around the handle of her coffee mug. She glanced up at the clock on the wall, a little too quickly. “Oh dear, I didn’t realise the time,” she said, her voice suddenly light but with a hint of forced calm. “I really must be going.”</p>
<p>She stood up quickly, gathering her things, her usual composure faltering just slightly. “Don’t wait up for me,” she said, heading for the door without looking back.</p>
<p>Chloe watched Mrs. Harding leave, her mind churning. There was something off about the way she’d reacted, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.</p>
<p>“Odd,” Daniel said, his voice breaking the silence.</p>
<p>Chloe turned to him. “What’s odd?”</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed slightly, his analytical mind already chewing on the small detail. “Mrs. Harding doesn’t work on Fridays.”</p>
<p>Chloe glanced toward the kitchen door, where Mrs. Harding had disappeared moments before, her own curiosity piqued. “Hmm,” she murmured, her gaze lingering. Something about Mrs. Harding’s sudden rush felt... wrong.</p>
<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Chloe felt her breath catch as she tried to keep up. Daniel, as usual, was focused, charging ahead without a word. He hadn&#39;t spoken much since they&#39;d left Mrs. Harding’s house, his mind already working through the puzzle they were chasing. She slowed down, struggling to match his pace, but pushed herself over the broken fence that marked the boundary of the abandoned farmhouse.</p>
<p>As she rounded the corner, she found him standing still, staring intently through the back window.</p>
<p>“What is it?” she asked, walking over to peer inside.</p>
<p>Daniel didn’t take his eyes off the scene inside. &quot;Look at the kitchen table. And the fridge. That round shape with the top freezer—those appliances are from the 1950s.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe leaned closer to get a better view. The kitchen did look old, frozen in time. “So this place has been abandoned since then?”</p>
<p>Daniel gave a short nod, then turned sharply, heading toward an old shed nearby. Chloe followed, her curiosity piqued but still unsure of what Daniel was looking for.</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly and raised his hands, framing the scene in front of him with his fingers. “This is it. The spot from the photo. Mrs. Pompington and Marcus Devereaux were standing right here.”</p>
<p>Chloe looked in the same direction, recognising the shed and the house from the background of the photo they&#39;d found on the mayor’s laptop. “You’re right,” she said, “it does look like the place. So, what now?”</p>
<p>Without answering, Daniel went straight to the shed, tugging the rusty door open. It creaked in protest, revealing a cluttered interior of old farm tools and metal tins. Daniel’s eyes immediately locked onto a shelf.</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot; he called out, motioning Chloe over. One of the metal tins stood out from the rest, its surface noticeably cleaner. “Someone’s moved this recently.”</p>
<p>Chloe stepped closer, her eyes narrowing as she studied the shelf. “You’re right.”</p>
<p>Daniel, ever careful, pulled a pencil from his backpack and used it to gently turn the tin. The faded label revealed a skull and crossbones, followed by the words <strong>&#39;Sodium Cyanide&#39;</strong> and <strong>&#39;Poison.&#39;</strong></p>
<p>Chloe’s breath caught in her throat. “So this is where the cyanide came from?”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. “Yes. Back in the 1950s, sodium cyanide was commonly used for pest control on farms.”</p>
<p>Chloe stepped back, letting the reality of their discovery sink in. They had found the source of the poison. But something didn’t sit right.</p>
<p>“What does this mean for us?” she asked, stepping outside with Daniel following.</p>
<p>He paused, his brow furrowing as he processed the new information. “I think it means we missed someone on our list of suspects.”</p>
<p>“Marcus Devereaux?” Chloe asked, her mind immediately jumping to the connection.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, but there was hesitation in his response. “Yes, but...”</p>
<p>Chloe looked at him, her expression softening. “But what?”</p>
<p>Daniel’s face tightened, frustration evident. “It doesn’t make sense. Why would Mrs. Pompington kill her husband just because Marcus told her to? She’s powerful—she could stand up to him. She had no reason to do what he asked.”</p>
<p>Chloe watched Daniel struggle with the emotional logic of it. She knew this was where his logical mind faltered—understanding why someone would act irrationally, especially someone like Mrs. Pompington.</p>
<p>She stepped closer, her voice gentler now. “It’s not always about power, Daniel. It’s about fear.”</p>
<p>Daniel frowned, clearly still wrestling with the idea. “Fear of what? She doesn’t need Marcus. Why would she give in to him?”</p>
<p>Chloe sighed softly, trying to put it into words he could follow. “Sometimes it’s not about needing someone—it’s about what they know. People like Marcus, they hold things over others, use secrets to control them. Mrs. Pompington might have been terrified that whatever Marcus knew about her would come out. Maybe it’s something from her past, something she can’t let anyone know.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes flickered with a glimmer of understanding, though he still looked conflicted. “But she’s built a life for herself. Why wouldn’t she just face whatever it is? It’s irrational.”</p>
<p>Chloe gave him a sad smile. “People aren’t always logical, Daniel. Especially when they’re scared. Fear makes people do things they wouldn’t normally do, things they regret. Maybe Marcus threatened to ruin everything she’s worked for—her reputation, her place in society. It’s possible she thought killing the mayor was the only way to protect herself.”</p>
<p>Daniel fell silent, processing Chloe’s explanation. It still didn’t sit well with him, but he knew Chloe was right. People did irrational things when they were desperate.</p>
<p>“So,” Chloe said softly, “what do we do now?”</p>
<p>Daniel straightened up, his voice clear and resolved. “We take this to the Inspector. Between the cyanide, the photo, and Marcus’s involvement, it’s enough to push him to bring her in.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, though there was a heaviness in her heart. It was never easy, piecing together the darker sides of human nature. But that was what they were here to do—uncover the truth, no matter how messy it was.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe stepped into the police station, the faint buzz of activity filling the air. Behind the desk, a police officer looked up from her paperwork. “Morning,” she said, her voice polite but detached. “Can I help you with something?”</p>
<p>Before Chloe could speak, Daniel, with unusual certainty, took a step forward. “We’d like to speak with Inspector Haversham.”</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow, pleasantly surprised, but remained quiet, letting Daniel take the lead. The officer picked up the phone and dialled, her eyes shifting between them. A few hushed words later, she asked, “Your names?”</p>
<p>“Chloe Bennett and Daniel Turner,” Chloe responded, but Daniel was already scanning the station, his mind clearly elsewhere.</p>
<p>The officer relayed the names through the phone. Chloe couldn’t help but hear a faint groan from the other end of the line.</p>
<p>&quot;Take a seat,&quot; the officer instructed, her tone a touch softer now. “He’ll be out shortly.”</p>
<p>They settled onto the wooden benches lining the station. Chloe glanced at the worn wood beneath her, which looked as though it hadn’t seen varnish in decades. <strong>Benches from the 1950s too, probably,</strong> she thought, a small smile tugging at her lips.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before Inspector Haversham appeared, walking briskly toward them, his face wearing an expression of impatience. He stopped in front of them, hands on his hips. “Look,” he began, “I’m busy, so this better be worth my time.”</p>
<p>Chloe opened her mouth to respond, but Daniel, to her surprise, was already standing. “We believe Mrs. Pompington murdered her husband,” Daniel said, his voice steady and self-assured, cutting through the Inspector’s bluntness like a knife.</p>
<p>Chloe blinked, momentarily taken aback by his directness. A small thrill of pride washed over her as she watched him stand tall, his confidence radiating.</p>
<p>The Inspector paused, clearly not expecting such a composed statement from Daniel. His eyes narrowed in curiosity before he nodded. “Alright,” he said, his tone less dismissive now. “Come on through.”</p>
<p>They followed him to his office, a small but cluttered space filled with case files, loose paperwork, and the lingering smell of stale coffee. The Inspector dropped into the chair behind his desk and gestured for them to sit across from him.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; he said, leaning forward. &quot;Tell me what you’ve got.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel wasted no time, launching into a detailed breakdown of their findings. He methodically laid out the evidence, the motive, and how Mrs. Pompington’s opportunity aligned perfectly. His logical, step-by-step presentation left little room for doubt, and Chloe found herself nodding along as Daniel confidently pieced together the chain of events. His voice was calm, deliberate—no hesitation, no second-guessing.</p>
<p>By the time Daniel finished, the Inspector leaned back in his chair, his face unreadable. There was a beat of silence as he considered everything. Then, with a swift nod, he picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Send a team to bring in Mrs. Pompington,” he said into the receiver. “For questioning, at least.” He replaced the phone in its cradle and turned his attention back to them.</p>
<p>“I’m impressed,” the Inspector admitted, his tone carrying genuine respect now. “We’ll need the folder, laptop, and any other evidence you’ve gathered.”</p>
<p>Chloe, still processing Daniel’s unexpected assertiveness, quickly nodded. “We’ll bring them in right away.”</p>
<p>The Inspector’s gruff exterior softened slightly. “We were about to launch an official investigation,” he explained. “The lab reports just came back—cyanide in the mayor’s system. Looks like you’ve saved us a lot of work.”</p>
<p>Daniel offered a brief nod, his expression still calm, though Chloe could sense the satisfaction bubbling just beneath the surface. She felt a wave of warmth as she looked at him—this was a side of Daniel she hadn’t often seen, and it made her smile. He had come out of his shell, and she couldn’t have been prouder.</p>
<p>As they stood to leave, Chloe caught Daniel’s eye and gave him a quick, approving grin. “Well done,” she whispered as they walked out.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Chloe spent the afternoon collecting the mayor&#39;s laptop from Maisie and retrieving the resort folder and Daniel’s evidence chart from the craft workshop. After handing everything to Inspector Haversham, they were informed that Mrs. Pompington was now in an interview room. The Inspector thanked them for their work, leaving them feeling triumphant.</p>
<p>As they walked home, Daniel hummed an unfamiliar tune, his usual focus on the case finally lifted. Chloe, lighthearted as well, decided she’d grab her camera later and take some photos around town to celebrate their progress.</p>
<p>When they arrived home, they were greeted by Mrs. Harding, but something was off. Her usual composed demeanour was replaced by a nervousness Chloe had never seen before. Mrs. Harding had always been a steady presence in their lives, but now, her unease was palpable.</p>
<p>“I need to tell you something,” Mrs. Harding said, her voice slightly unsteady. “Let’s sit down in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel exchanged curious glances, sensing the gravity of the situation. They followed Mrs. Harding into the kitchen, where they all sat down at the table. Mrs. Harding clasped her hands together, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>“What I’m about to tell you cannot leave this room. Do you understand?” she asked, her eyes sharp, filled with a seriousness that left no room for argument.</p>
<p>Both nodded, replying in unison, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding exhaled slowly before beginning. “About twenty years ago, I worked with Elizabeth Pompington at MI5.”</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel’s eyes widened in shock. Mrs. Harding, with a past at MI5? It was a side of her neither had ever imagined. She had always seemed like a mother figure—reliable, nurturing, and practical. That she had led a secret life as a spy was a revelation.</p>
<p>“Now, we weren’t out there like James Bond,” Mrs. Harding continued, her voice steady but with a slight edge of nostalgia. “Most of the time, we were behind desks, sifting through intelligence files, connecting dots, playing a quiet game of cat and mouse with criminal networks. Occasionally, we’d get out into the field—nothing glamorous, but sometimes we had to travel abroad, conduct interviews with people who didn’t want to be found. But the bulk of the work was analysing, watching, and waiting.”</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, then continued. “Elizabeth—well, you know her as Mrs. Pompington—and I worked on a case called <strong>Operation Shadow Water</strong>. It was a deep-cover investigation into international money laundering rings operating through the UK. London was a hotspot for it back then—still is, truth be told. The syndicates we were after had ties to everything: drugs, arms trafficking, you name it.”</p>
<p>Chloe leaned forward, listening intently, her mind racing. <strong>Money laundering</strong>—it all made sense now.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding continued, “The nature of the operation required us to go undercover. Marcus Devereaux—Elizabeth’s ‘brother’—wasn’t really her brother. That was part of our cover story. Marcus was another agent, sent in to infiltrate one of the syndicates posing as a businessman with criminal ties. Elizabeth and Marcus pretended to be siblings to give them a reason to meet frequently without raising suspicion. It allowed Marcus to worm his way into the inner circle of the people we were investigating.”</p>
<p>Daniel remained silent, his focus fixed on Mrs. Harding’s every word. Chloe could tell he was absorbing it all, piecing together how it connected to the case.</p>
<p>“Elizabeth and I left MI5 a little over ten years ago,” Mrs. Harding said. “But Marcus stayed on, still running Shadow Water. It was dangerous work—these criminals are ruthless—but he was good at it. Quiet, methodical, like you, Daniel,” she added with a small, reassuring smile.</p>
<p>Chloe suddenly gasped, realising the enormity of what Mrs. Harding had just revealed. “And then she contacted Marcus last year,” Chloe said softly. “For help with her husband’s resort project.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding nodded. “Yes. The mayor had gotten himself in deep. He’d partnered with Henry Davenport, but he grew suspicious when he noticed the money being shifted around in strange ways. He asked Elizabeth to help—he knew she had experience with money laundering from her days at MI5. She reached out to Marcus, and together they added <strong>ShadowWater Developments</strong> to the project as a contractor to keep an eye on things.”</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back, the pieces falling into place. “So Marcus was monitoring the financial side, following the money?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Mrs. Harding said. “About a month ago, Marcus uncovered proof that Davenport Enterprises was laundering money through the project. He sent the evidence to Elizabeth.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Daniel shot up from his chair, slapping his forehead with the palm of his hand. “We need to go!” he exclaimed, his voice sharp with urgency.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, startled by his outburst, stood up. “Daniel, what’s wrong?” she asked, concern knitting her brow.</p>
<p>“We got it wrong,” Daniel said, his voice full of frustration. “Mrs. Pompington’s in jail because I got it wrong.”</p>
<p>“Sit down, Daniel,” Mrs. Harding said firmly. “Now, calmly, tell me what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Daniel sat back down, his hands tapping at his temples, eyes fixed on the table as he began to explain. “We told the police it was Mrs. Pompington. We thought she killed her husband. We gave them all the evidence we found, but… but it doesn’t fit anymore.” His words tumbled out, one after another, as he methodically ran through everything they had presented to Inspector Haversham.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding absorbed the information, her expression unreadable. “I see,” she said after a moment. “But there’s a problem. We can’t go to the police and tell them we’ve changed our minds without exposing Marcus’s role in the investigation. That would put him in danger—and you two as well.”</p>
<p>“We can’t just leave her in jail,” Chloe interjected, her voice rising in protest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding’s voice remained calm, but her eyes were sharp. “We must. And we can. Elizabeth’s tougher than you think. She’s been through worse.”</p>
<p>Chloe stared at her, incredulous. “But what about Henry? And the real killer?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding’s face softened just slightly. “That’s your next step, isn’t it? If we’re going to get Elizabeth out of jail without blowing the operation, you two are going to have to catch the real murderer. Quietly.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<p>The craft workshop was dimly lit, save for the soft glow of a desk lamp illuminating the large sheet of paper Daniel had spread out on the table. Chloe sat beside him, watching as he carefully drew lines between the names of suspects, jotting down every detail they had so far—every clue, motive, and alibi. The paper quickly filled with Daniel’s precise handwriting, but certain names—Mrs. Harding, Mrs. Pompington, and Marcus Devereaux—were conspicuously absent. Their MI5 history was too secret to document.</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back in her chair, rubbing her eyes. “It feels like we’re going in circles,” she muttered.</p>
<p>Daniel didn’t respond, his focus intense as he methodically worked through the chart. Chloe could see he wasn’t just distracted by the case—he was wrestling with guilt over their earlier assumption about Mrs. Pompington.</p>
<p>She sighed and stood up, pacing. “You think we’re missing something obvious?”</p>
<p>Daniel finally looked up from his work, his expression unreadable. “Yes,” he said quietly. “But I don’t know what yet.”</p>
<p>The workshop, usually a place of comfort filled with wood shavings and tools, felt far less inviting tonight. Chloe wandered to the window, looking out at the darkening sky. They’d been at it for hours, piecing things together, but some critical details still eluded them.</p>
<p>The door creaked open behind her, and Chloe turned to see Mrs. Harding stepping in, followed by Rosie Gallagher carrying a tray piled high with <strong>steaming mugs of hot chocolate</strong>, <strong>pies</strong>, and <strong>cake</strong>.</p>
<p>“Thought you two could use a break,” Rosie said with a grin, her freckled face glowing in the soft light. “You look like you’ve been here since the dawn of time.”</p>
<p>Chloe smiled gratefully. “Feels like it.”</p>
<p>Rosie set the tray down on a nearby bench, and Mrs. Harding sat down with a sigh. “Any progress?” she asked, glancing at the evidence chart.</p>
<p>Daniel tapped the paper in front of him, frustration creasing his brow. “We’ve been through the suspects, the motives, the timelines… but we’re still stuck on <strong>how</strong> Henry Davenport got cyanide into the mayor’s water.”</p>
<p>Rosie, who had been handing out mugs, suddenly froze. “Wait, what did you just say?”</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, repeating patiently, “How did Henry Davenport get cyanide into the mayor’s water?”</p>
<p>Rosie set down the tray and came over to the chart, her brows furrowed. “Hang on a minute… I think I know the answer to that.”</p>
<p>Chloe and Daniel exchanged a glance. “What do you mean?” Chloe asked, leaning forward.</p>
<p>Rosie pulled up a chair and sat down, her eyes scanning the chart. “You see, Mrs. Pompington always used to buy bottled water from me. Every time there was an event, she’d come by and pick up a couple of bottles. But this time, for the Christmas lights ceremony, she didn’t.”</p>
<p>Chloe frowned. “So where did she get the water?”</p>
<p>“From Henry,” Rosie said, nodding as the memory resurfaced. “He came by the bakery the day before the event and told me not to worry about supplying the water for Mrs. Pompington. He said he’d sorted it out himself.”</p>
<p>Daniel sat up straighter, his fingers tapping at the table. “So Henry supplied the water for the mayor’s speech?”</p>
<p>Rosie nodded, her eyes wide. “Exactly. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Henry can be a bit controlling, and I just figured he wanted everything to run smoothly, you know?”</p>
<p>Chloe’s jaw tightened, the pieces clicking into place. “And Mrs. Pompington, completely unaware, handed the water bottle to the mayor.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Rosie said. “Henry must have tampered with the water beforehand. She wouldn’t have suspected a thing.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s mind was already running through the logistics. “If Henry handled the water directly, he had ample opportunity to poison it before giving it to Mrs. Pompington.”</p>
<p>Chloe shivered slightly at how easily the cyanide could have gone unnoticed. “Henry made sure to control the situation. He knew the water would go from Mrs. Pompington to the mayor, and he was careful enough to stay at arm’s length.”</p>
<p>Rosie leaned back, satisfied that her memory had given them a key piece of the puzzle. “It all fits, doesn’t it? The perfect setup.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, who had been quietly observing, took a sip of her hot chocolate before speaking. “We already knew the mayor was going to expose Henry’s money laundering activities. That gave Henry a strong motive. But now we know the method.”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, adding a thick line on the chart, connecting <strong>Henry Davenport</strong> to the <strong>bottle of water</strong>. “Henry knew that if the mayor exposed him, he’d lose everything—his business, his reputation, maybe even his freedom.”</p>
<p>Chloe sighed. “It’s a solid motive. Henry’s company was dropped from the resort project, and that was the final straw. He couldn’t let the mayor go public.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why he killed him,” Daniel finished, his voice calm but full of certainty.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding set her mug down, her expression thoughtful. “Henry’s not going to be easy to pin down. He’s clever. He’s already manipulated everything to frame Mrs. Pompington.”</p>
<p>“True,” Chloe said. “But now we know how he did it. That gives us leverage.”</p>
<p>Rosie’s eyes darted between them, her expression full of concern. “But are you sure you have enough to take this to the police? I mean, knowing it’s Henry and proving it in court are two very different things.”</p>
<p>Daniel, ever meticulous, was already reviewing the chart again. “We have motive, means, and opportunity,” he said, tapping each point on the paper. “But you’re right, we need something more solid. Something that directly links Henry to the cyanide.”</p>
<p>Chloe leaned back, rubbing her temples. “What about the bottle itself? Could we trace it back to him?”</p>
<p>Rosie shook her head. “Not easily. Henry’s smart—he wouldn’t leave something as obvious as a receipt or a traceable purchase. He probably sourced it through a third party, or even under someone else’s name.”</p>
<p>Chloe frowned. “That’s going to be a problem.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s fingers drummed on the table as he thought. “There has to be something… a mistake, somewhere. If he’s been laundering money, there could be a trail.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding nodded. “If you dig deep enough into his financials, you might find something he overlooked.”</p>
<p>Rosie smiled. “Well, you’re going to need your strength if you’re going to take him down.” She handed Chloe a plate with a slice of pie. “Start with this.”</p>
<p>Chloe laughed, taking a bite. “You’re right. This is probably the only thing keeping me going right now.”</p>
<p>Daniel, still absorbed in his thoughts, glanced at the clock. It was getting late, but he wasn’t ready to stop. “Tomorrow, we’ll go through Henry’s financial records again. There’s more to uncover, I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding stood up, stretching. “Just be careful. Henry’s dangerous, but he’s not invincible. Stick to the facts and keep a low profile.”</p>
<p>Rosie gave a mock salute. “Don’t worry, Daniel’s got a mind like a steel trap. If anyone’s going to catch him, it’s you two.” She smiled warmly at them.</p>
<p>Chloe looked at Daniel with admiration. Despite everything, his calm determination remained intact. And for the first time in hours, she felt like they were closing in.</p>
<p>As they packed up for the night, Daniel carefully rolled up the evidence chart and set it aside. “We’re almost there,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, feeling the same sense of momentum. “Tomorrow, we find the final piece.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel sat at the table in the craft workshop, frustration etched on his face. His pen tapped rhythmically against his notebook, the evidence chart spread out before him, a series of dead ends crisscrossing the page.</p>
<p>“We were so close,” Daniel muttered, staring at the empty space where the laptop once sat. “That photo could have given us everything. Now the police have it.”</p>
<p>Chloe sat across from him, equally drained. She’d seen Daniel frustrated before, but tonight it was more intense, more personal. The weight of Mrs. Pompington’s arrest had clearly unsettled him.</p>
<p>“Maybe…” Chloe started, glancing down at her phone as a thought struck her. “Maybe the laptop isn’t our only option.”</p>
<p>Daniel stopped his tapping. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Chloe’s fingers moved quickly over her phone screen. “What if the laptop was backed up to the cloud? Maisie would know if there was some kind of sync going on. She’s good with tech.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes brightened. “The cloud backup might have something we missed—or at least the metadata from the photo.”</p>
<p>Chloe’s thumbs flew over the keys, typing a quick message to Maisie: <strong>Was the mayor&#39;s laptop backed up to the cloud? We’re hoping the photo metadata might give us a lead.</strong></p>
<p>Daniel leaned forward, his foot tapping anxiously against the floor. “We’ll have to wait until the morning, though, right?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Maisie’s probably asleep,” Chloe said, nodding toward the clock on the wall. It was late—too late for anyone to be working.</p>
<p>But then Chloe’s phone buzzed. Maisie had responded much faster than expected. <strong>Yeah, it’s backed up in the cloud. I already checked, but I didn’t see anything extra. Want me to send you the files?</strong></p>
<p>Chloe read the message aloud, then quickly responded: <strong>Can you check the metadata on the photo? We’re hoping it’ll tell us who took it.</strong></p>
<p>Moments later, Maisie’s next text appeared: <strong>Sure, give me a sec. I’ll pull it up.</strong></p>
<p>Daniel began pacing again, the wheels in his mind already spinning. “If the metadata shows Henry’s name or device, we’ll have proof he took the photo. It means he knew where the cyanide was—and that he tried to frame Mrs. Pompington.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. “If Henry took that photo, it places him right at the farmhouse. We’d have him dead to rights.”</p>
<p>Another buzz from Chloe’s phone broke the silence. <strong>I’ve got something interesting for you</strong>, Maisie’s message read. <strong>Metadata says the photo was taken on a DSLR registered to Henry Davenport.</strong></p>
<p>Chloe read the message aloud, excitement flooding her chest. “Henry took the photo!”</p>
<p>Daniel stopped pacing and turned to face her, his eyes sharp. “That’s it, Chloe. He knew where the cyanide was, and he used the photo to lead us there, so we’d accuse Mrs. Pompington.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded, her mind working just as fast. “But Maisie said she didn’t see anything else in the backup. What if we’re still missing something?”</p>
<p>She quickly typed back to Maisie: <strong>Can you double-check the cloud backup? There might be a hidden folder or something that didn’t show up before.</strong></p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, another message appeared. <strong>Give me a sec. I’ll look deeper.</strong></p>
<p>Daniel’s foot tapped faster as they waited, both of them feeling the urgency building. Chloe held her breath as she stared at her phone, willing Maisie to find something.</p>
<p>Finally, Maisie texted back: <strong>You were right! There’s a hidden folder in the backup. Looks like it’s full of documents. Do you want me to send them over?</strong></p>
<p>Chloe’s heart raced. “There’s a hidden folder.”</p>
<p>“What’s in it?” Daniel asked, his tone intense, his eyes glued to her.</p>
<p>Chloe texted back: <strong>Yes, send everything.</strong></p>
<p>Maisie’s response came within seconds: <strong>Sending now.</strong></p>
<p>Chloe opened the folder as the files came through, her eyes scanning the titles. “There are emails… documents related to the resort… bank transactions…”</p>
<p>Daniel leaned over her shoulder, his voice barely more than a whisper. “This is it.”</p>
<p>One of the files caught Chloe’s eye. “Look at this,” she said, opening the document. “It’s a series of emails between Marcus Devereaux and the mayor.”</p>
<p>Daniel scanned the emails, his jaw tightening. “The mayor found out about Henry’s money laundering. He was going to expose him. That’s why Henry had to act.”</p>
<p>Daniel stood up, running his hand through his hair. “Henry took the photo, knew where the cyanide was, and used it to kill the mayor before he could expose him.”</p>
<p>“And he left Mrs. Pompington to take the fall,” Chloe finished, her voice low but steady.</p>
<p>Daniel tapped his temple, thinking quickly. “Tomorrow, we take all of this to Inspector Haversham. Between the metadata and these emails, we’ve got enough to force him to bring Henry in.”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. “But we need to move fast. If Henry realises we’re onto him, he could destroy more evidence—or worse, disappear.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s mind was racing again, already planning the next steps. “We’ll meet Maisie first thing in the morning. Then we’ll confront Henry.”</p>
<p>Chloe quickly texted Maisie: <strong>Meet us at the workshop tomorrow at 9. We’ll go through everything.</strong></p>
<p>Maisie responded almost instantly: <strong>You got it. See you in the morning.</strong></p>
<p>Chloe turned to Daniel, who had finally stopped pacing and was now staring at the chart, his mind focused. “We’ve got him,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>Chloe smiled. “Tomorrow, we finish this.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<p>Daniel arrived at the craft workshop early, eager to dive into the contents of the mayor&#39;s cloud account. His mind had been buzzing with possibilities ever since they uncovered the hidden folder. He moved quickly to his usual workbench, setting out his notebook, ready to take more notes.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Maisie walked in, carrying her laptop under one arm. &quot;Morning,&quot; she said brightly as she set it down on the workbench. &quot;Let’s get this thing fired up.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel barely acknowledged her, his focus already on the task ahead. Maisie logged into the mayor’s cloud service and pulled up the hidden folder they had discovered yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;Where’s Chloe?&quot; Maisie asked, glancing around as she typed in the credentials.</p>
<p>Daniel glanced up briefly. &quot;She’s grabbing breakfast from Rosie’s.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie nodded and continued to work, clicking through the folder’s contents. Soon, the screen displayed three subfolders: <strong>Correspondence</strong>, <strong>Financials</strong>, and <strong>Marcus.</strong></p>
<p>“There we go,” Maisie said, gesturing toward the screen. “What are you going to start with?”</p>
<p>Daniel leaned forward, clicking on <strong>Correspondence</strong> first. His eyes darted across the emails between the mayor, Marcus Devereaux, and Henry Davenport. The first few emails were typical business exchanges—discussions of timelines, budgets, and minor project updates. But then, a few emails in, Daniel’s brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“The mayor’s worried,” he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Maisie leaned over. “What about?”</p>
<p>Daniel pointed to the screen. “Look at this—he’s expressing concern about corruption within <strong>ShadowWater Developments</strong>. He’s convinced there’s something wrong.”</p>
<p>Maisie’s eyes widened. “So he figured it out.”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, scrolling further. “Yeah, and he acted on it. He cancels the contract with both ShadowWater Developments and Davenport Enterprises.” He clicked on the final email in the thread, reading aloud: “**Henry** expresses his ‘disappointment’ but doesn’t push back. It seems like Henry was trying to play it cool, but...”</p>
<p>Maisie whistled. “So the mayor had already removed them from the project.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” Daniel sat back, thinking. “Henry must’ve realised the mayor wasn’t buying it anymore, but he didn’t know about the deeper investigation.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Maisie’s input, Daniel clicked into the second folder: <strong>Financials</strong>. It was filled with detailed documents tracking the flow of money between <strong>Davenport Enterprises</strong> and the shell companies under the directorship of <strong>Harvey Denton</strong>—Henry’s alias.</p>
<p>Daniel scrolled through the complex web of transactions, impressed by the precision with which Marcus had tracked it all. Each document meticulously outlined how money was being funneled between shell companies, eventually landing in Davenport Enterprises.</p>
<p>“This is...” Daniel paused, his voice quieter than usual. “Marcus did an incredible job with this. Look at how much detail there is. Every transaction is accounted for. This is the money laundering operation.”</p>
<p>Maisie leaned in closer. “He caught them red-handed.”</p>
<p>Daniel continued to read. “The money’s coming from <strong>drug sales</strong> and <strong>car thefts</strong>. Marcus documented everything.”</p>
<p>Maisie shook her head in disbelief. “No wonder they were so desperate to cover this up. If Henry knew Marcus had this level of detail…”</p>
<p>“He would’ve done anything to keep it quiet,” Daniel finished.</p>
<p>The two sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the information settling in. They were close—so close to uncovering the entire operation. But then Maisie glanced at the clock and frowned.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said. “Chloe’s been gone a while, hasn’t she?”</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, the realisation hitting him. “Yeah… longer than it should’ve taken.”</p>
<p>He pulled out his phone, about to text Chloe, when the door to the workshop creaked open, and Chloe stepped inside, balancing a paper bag filled with breakfast and two takeaway coffees.</p>
<p>“Finally,” Maisie said, exhaling. “We were starting to get worried.”</p>
<p>Chloe smiled, setting the food and drinks down on the table. “Sorry, Rosie was being chatty. She had some gossip I thought you two might want to hear.”</p>
<p>Daniel, intrigued, immediately perked up. “Gossip?”</p>
<p>Chloe unwrapped one of the breakfast sandwiches and handed it to Daniel. “Yeah, she overheard Henry talking to someone outside the café yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Henry?” Maisie repeated, her tone growing serious.</p>
<p>Chloe nodded. “And it wasn’t just anyone. The man Henry was with—it was the same guy who attacked Maisie at the old mill.”</p>
<p>Maisie stiffened. “What? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Chloe nodded again. “Rosie said it took her a minute to place him, but it’s definitely the same guy. And here’s the kicker—Rosie overheard them talking about Henry leaving the country.”</p>
<p>Daniel froze, processing the new information. “Leaving the country?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” Chloe said. “Henry told the guy that he didn’t feel safe anymore. He said something like, ‘I’m going to have to get out soon. It’s not safe for me here anymore.’”</p>
<p>Maisie put down her coffee. “He’s preparing to run.”</p>
<p>“That’s what it sounds like,” Chloe agreed. “He’s planning to disappear before we can get to him.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s mind raced. The money laundering, the threats, the mayor’s murder—it was all connected. Now Henry was getting ready to flee. If they didn’t act fast, they’d lose their only chance to catch him.</p>
<p>“We need to move,” Daniel said, his voice steely. “We’ve got to figure out Henry’s next step before he makes a run for it.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Chloe grabbed her jacket from the back of the chair and stretched. &quot;I’ll go fetch us some lunch from Rosie’s,&quot; she said, giving Maisie and Daniel a smile. &quot;Rosie’s still got us covered—free food while we work on the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel barely looked up from the laptop, engrossed in the hidden folder Maisie had pulled up. Maisie waved absently, focused on the financial documents.</p>
<p>Chloe left the craft workshop, her mind fixed on the investigation. She still couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more to the incident with Maisie a few days ago—the man who had assaulted Maisie at the old mill. They knew the attack was connected to Henry, but Chloe felt that there might be another layer to the story they hadn’t uncovered yet.</p>
<p>As she crossed the square toward Rosie’s café, Chloe noticed something she hadn’t before: a <strong>CCTV camera</strong> mounted on the shop next to Rosie’s. It was positioned perfectly, aimed directly at the café and the area where Maisie had been talking to the man.</p>
<p><strong>Of course. CCTV footage.</strong></p>
<p>Why hadn’t she thought of it sooner? Maisie had been talking to the man outside the café before he took her to the old mill. Maybe there was something in the footage that could tie the man more directly to Henry. Chloe’s pulse quickened. <strong>This could be what they were missing.</strong></p>
<p>She pushed open the door to the shop, the bell tinkling softly as she entered. The shopkeeper, a friendly man in his fifties, smiled at her from behind the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning, love. What can I do for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Morning,&quot; Chloe replied with a smile. &quot;I was wondering if you could help me with something. You’ve got a CCTV camera outside, right?&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;Aye, I do. Why d’you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Chloe continued, &quot;I’m working on the mayor’s case with the police, and a few days ago, one of my friends—Maisie—was talking to a man outside Rosie’s café. That same man later attacked her, and I think your camera might have caught the interaction. Could I take a look at the footage?&quot;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper’s brows rose in surprise, but after a moment of consideration, he shrugged. &quot;Alright, let’s have a look. Come on back.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe followed him into a small back office, cluttered with boxes and a dated computer. The shopkeeper sat at the desk and began clicking through the CCTV footage.</p>
<p>&quot;What time were you thinkin’?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two days ago, when Maisie was attacked,&quot; Chloe replied.</p>
<p>The screen flickered to life, showing the footage outside the café. Chloe leaned in, her heart racing as she scanned the video. And then she saw it—Maisie standing outside the café, talking to the man. The same man who had later attacked her at the mill.</p>
<p>She focused on the man’s body language. His movements were aggressive, even from this distance, and Maisie looked uncomfortable. Chloe&#39;s stomach twisted.</p>
<p>Then the man suddenly grabbed Maisie’s arm. Chloe’s eyes widened as she watched in horror as he dragged Maisie away from the café, disappearing out of frame.</p>
<p><strong>Maisie hadn’t just been talking to him—she’d been forcibly taken.</strong></p>
<p>Chloe’s mind raced. This footage could provide more context for the attack. &quot;Can I get a copy of this?&quot; she asked, her voice urgent.</p>
<p>&quot;Aye, no problem.&quot; The shopkeeper reached into a display shelf and pulled out a small USB drive. &quot;I sell these. You can use one of these to save the footage.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe quickly paid for the drive and watched as he copied the footage.</p>
<p>“Sorry, could I have a look at the footage from yesterday ,” Chloe replied. “Around midday.”</p>
<p>The man nodded and fast-forwarded to the footage. Chloe watched anxiously as the screen flickered to life. The camera view showed the front of Rosie’s café, with the town square in the background. People bustled by, and then—there he was. <strong>Henry Davenport.</strong></p>
<p>Chloe’s heart skipped a beat. Henry was standing just outside Rosie’s, talking to someone. The angle wasn’t perfect, but Chloe recognised the other man almost immediately. It was the man who had attacked Maisie.</p>
<p>The two men were deep in conversation, their body language tense. Chloe leaned closer to the screen, watching as Henry gestured toward something in his hand—a small package. She couldn’t make out the details, but whatever it was, Henry handed it to the other man with a look of grim determination.</p>
<p>Then they walked out of frame.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you save that footage for me too?&quot; Chloe asked.</p>
<p>Once the file was saved, she tucked the drive safely into her pocket. &quot;Thank you so much,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>With that done, Chloe hurried back out onto the square, her mind buzzing. She had the footage of Maisie’s abduction, but she wasn’t done yet. <strong>There was still one more camera to check.</strong></p>
<p>Chloe jogged across the square to <strong>Evelyn Marsh’s bakery</strong>, where another CCTV camera was mounted. If her hunch was right, it would have captured the backstage area of the Christmas lights ceremony—the perfect angle to catch Henry’s movements.</p>
<p>She pushed open the door to the bakery, the smell of fresh bread greeting her. Evelyn looked up from behind the counter and smiled warmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Chloe, love! What brings you in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need to ask a favour, Evelyn,&quot; Chloe said, breathless from her run. &quot;It’s to do with the mayor’s case. Do you still have the CCTV footage from the night of the ceremony?&quot;</p>
<p>Evelyn’s smile faded slightly, but she nodded. &quot;I reckon we do. Why? What are you looking for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it might have caught something important backstage,&quot; Chloe explained. &quot;Could I take a look?&quot;</p>
<p>Evelyn hesitated, then nodded. &quot;Of course. Anything to help.&quot;</p>
<p>She led Chloe into the back of the bakery where the CCTV system was set up. Chloe’s hands trembled slightly as Evelyn pulled up the footage. She fast-forwarded to the night of the ceremony, her heart pounding in her chest as she scanned the screen.</p>
<p>There—Henry Davenport, pacing backstage before the mayor’s speech. Chloe leaned closer. <strong>He was up to something.</strong></p>
<p>And then she saw it. Henry walked over to the table where the mayor’s water bottle sat. He looked around, checking to see if anyone was watching. Then, with a swift, practiced movement, he pulled something from his pocket—a syringe. <strong>He injected a clear liquid into the water bottle</strong> before sealing it back up and walking away.</p>
<p>Chloe’s breath caught. <strong>That was it.</strong></p>
<p>Her heart raced as she fumbled for the USB drive in her pocket. &quot;Evelyn, can I save this footage onto here?&quot; she asked, holding up the drive.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Evelyn replied, looking startled by Chloe’s intensity.</p>
<p>Chloe quickly saved the footage and pocketed the drive. She couldn’t believe it. <strong>They had him. They had proof that Henry had poisoned the mayor.</strong></p>
<p>She couldn’t hold back her excitement. &quot;We got him!&quot; she exclaimed, practically bouncing on her feet.</p>
<p>Evelyn blinked in surprise. &quot;Is that good news, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The best!&quot; Chloe grinned. &quot;Thank you, Evelyn. I’ve got to get back to Daniel and Maisie.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, Chloe rushed out of the bakery, her heart pounding with excitement. <strong>They finally had everything they needed to bring Henry Davenport down.</strong></p>
<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<p>Chloe walked into Rosie’s café with a huge smile. The familiar warmth of the place immediately put her at ease, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods filling the air. Rosie was busy at a nearby table, taking an order from a couple of regulars. She spotted Chloe as she walked in and gave a cheerful wave. Chloe waved back and settled into a seat near the window, her mind buzzing with excitement.</p>
<p>She pulled out her phone and dialled Maisie’s number. It only rang once before Maisie picked up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hiya,&quot; Maisie’s voice came through, light but tired.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi,&quot; Chloe replied. &quot;Why don’t you and Daniel come down to the café? I’ve got some great news, and I think it’ll do you both good to get out of the workshop and away from the laptop for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a pause on the other end, followed by some muffled talking. Chloe imagined Maisie covering the phone to check with Daniel, who was probably so absorbed in the spreadsheets and documents on the mayor’s laptop that he hadn’t noticed the time. Maisie came back on the line.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, we’ll be there in about 15 minutes,&quot; Maisie said, a hint of curiosity in her voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Perfect,&quot; Chloe said, and hung up, her fingers still tingling with anticipation.</p>
<p>Just as she slipped the phone back into her pocket, Rosie walked over, wiping her hands on her apron before sitting down across from Chloe with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;You’re looking much happier than you were this morning. Today been productive, then?&quot; Rosie asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.</p>
<p>Chloe grinned. She couldn’t contain her excitement. &quot;Oh, yes. It’s been more than productive. I think I’ve found the final nail in Henry’s coffin. We’ve got all the evidence we need to put him away for good.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. &quot;Really? That’s brilliant news! I knew you three would get there, but this is quicker than I expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe’s heart was still racing with the thrill of it all. &quot;Honestly, Rosie, it feels like a weight has been lifted off. I can’t wait to show Daniel and Maisie the footage I found. Once they see it, there’s no question Henry’s guilty.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie gave her a proud nod. &quot;I knew you’d figure it out, love. So, what’s the plan then? You celebrating here, or are you grabbing something to go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel and Maisie are coming down to join me,&quot; Chloe said, leaning back in her chair. &quot;We’ll eat here, I think. I want us all to have a proper meal together, maybe even talk through the next steps.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie clapped her hands together and stood up, her apron swaying as she moved. &quot;Right, I’d better get started in the kitchen then! I’ll whip up something special.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe watched as Rosie disappeared into the back, leaving her alone with her thoughts. She turned to look out the window, the bright daylight streaming in through the glass and casting a warm glow over the town square. It felt like everything was finally falling into place. The end was in sight, and the sense of accomplishment was almost overwhelming.</p>
<p>She could already imagine Daniel’s reaction—how his usually calm, methodical demeanour might crack just a little when he realised they’d done it. Maisie would probably jump out of her seat, eager to analyse the final details.</p>
<p>Her excitement, however, was interrupted when she spotted something across the square that made her stomach drop. A figure moving swiftly, just out of the corner of her eye. <strong>No, not just anyone—Henry Davenport.</strong></p>
<p>He was walking toward one of the side streets, looking over his shoulder as though he didn’t want to be seen. Chloe’s mind raced. <strong>What was he doing here?</strong> Why would he be skulking around town after everything they’d uncovered? Surely, he would’ve heard by now that the investigation was closing in on him.</p>
<p>Her pulse quickened. Something didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>Chloe fumbled for her phone, unlocking it and quickly opening the Notes app. Her fingers moved fast, typing a message she hoped Daniel would understand. If she was going to follow Henry, she needed to make sure Daniel and Maisie knew something was up, just in case.</p>
<p>She stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor, and made her way to the counter. Rosie had just reappeared from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel.</p>
<p>&quot;Rosie,&quot; Chloe said, her voice low but urgent, &quot;I need to pop out for a minute. Could you do me a favour?&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie, noticing Chloe’s sudden change in demeanour, frowned slightly. &quot;Of course, what’s going on?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe quickly grabbed a pen from the counter and a Post-it note, scribbling down the words <strong>&quot;Urgent - check my phone&quot;</strong> before folding the note in half. She then slipped her phone, the USB drive containing the evidence, and the note into a small paper bag from the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;If Daniel and Maisie get here before I’m back,&quot; Chloe said, pushing the bag toward Rosie, &quot;please give them this. It’s important.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie’s frown deepened, her eyes flicking between the bag and Chloe’s face. &quot;Are you alright, love? What’s going on?&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe forced a smile, though she could feel the tension building inside her. &quot;I’m fine. I just—there’s something I need to check on. I’ll be back soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie hesitated, clearly not convinced, but nodded. &quot;Alright, but you be careful, yeah?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will,&quot; Chloe said, grateful for Rosie’s concern. She gave a final glance out the window—Henry was gone now, but she was determined to find him.</p>
<p>Chloe stepped out of the café, feeling the cool breeze hit her face. The thrill of their victory moments ago was replaced by a gnawing worry in her gut. She had to know what Henry was up to. If they could catch him before he made his next move, they could stop whatever plan he was hatching.</p>
<p>Rosie watched as Chloe disappeared down the street, the paper bag sitting on the counter, waiting for Daniel and Maisie.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Come on, Daniel, it’s been over five minutes since Chloe called,&quot; Maisie pleaded, glancing at her watch with growing impatience. &quot;She’s going to get worried if we don’t show up soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel sighed, his eyes still fixed on the laptop screen. He tapped the keyboard, scrolling through the last few spreadsheets. &quot;We have all the motive we need,&quot; he mumbled, more to himself than to Maisie. &quot;We’re just missing that final piece.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie, already standing holding her backpack, crossed her arms. &quot;Chloe said she had some good news, remember? Maybe she found what we’re looking for.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel rubbed his eyes, finally conceding. &quot;I hope so,&quot; he said quietly, the weight of their work making him sluggish as he stood up.</p>
<p>Maisie wasted no time, quickly grabbing the laptop from the workbench and stuffing it into her bag. She snatched up the empty coffee cups and discarded papers, tossing them into the bin as she followed Daniel toward the door. He was already halfway out by the time she’d finished tidying up.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait for me!&quot; Maisie called, her voice tinged with exasperation as Daniel’s long strides carried him through the door without so much as a backward glance. That’s the problem with Daniel—he’s always so focused on the next task, so wrapped up in his thoughts that he forgets anyone else is with him.</p>
<p>Maisie caught up with him halfway to the market square, panting slightly as her bag weighed heavily on her back. The laptop, still warm from hours of use, pressed uncomfortably against her spine. &quot;Could you slow down a bit?&quot; she huffed, adjusting the straps of her backpack. &quot;I’ve got shorter legs, you know, and I’m carrying a whole computer in here.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel slowed his pace without a word, but his mind was still clearly racing. &quot;Henry was laundering tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of pounds,&quot; he said, shaking his head as though the sheer scale of it baffled him. &quot;I’m amazed he’s managed to keep it hidden for so long.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie adjusted her backpack again, trying to make it sit more comfortably. &quot;Isn’t that enough to put him away?&quot; she asked. &quot;I mean, people go to prison for that, don’t they?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded absently, his eyes still distant as they crossed the square. &quot;Oh, definitely,&quot; he replied, then hesitated before adding, &quot;But we need to prove he murdered the mayor.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie frowned. &quot;Why? Isn’t it enough to lock him up for money laundering?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel stopped for a moment, turning toward her. His tone softened slightly as he explained, &quot;No. Not when Mrs Pompington is still being accused of the murder. We need to prove that someone else did it—**we need to clear her name.**&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie thought about that as they walked into the market square, the bustling activity of the town seeming like a world apart from the tangled web they were trying to unravel. Her backpack shifted awkwardly with every step, but she barely noticed now, her thoughts consumed by the weight of their investigation.</p>
<p>As they approached Rosie’s café, Maisie spotted something out of the corner of her eye. A fleeting figure, disappearing into one of the alleyways. &quot;Was that Chloe?&quot; she asked, squinting toward the narrow street.</p>
<p>Daniel glanced over but shook his head. &quot;I didn’t see her.&quot;</p>
<p>They pushed open the door to the café, the comforting smell of freshly brewed coffee and hot food wafting over them. Rosie was wiping down a table near the window, and she looked up with a warm smile when she saw them.</p>
<p>&quot;You just missed Chloe,&quot; she said, her voice light but with a hint of curiosity. She reached behind the counter and handed Daniel a paper bag. &quot;She asked me to give this to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel took the bag, his brow furrowed as he peered inside. &quot;Where did she go?&quot; he asked, a touch of concern creeping into his voice.</p>
<p>Rosie shrugged, her smile faltering slightly. &quot;She didn’t say, but she looked like she was in a bit of a rush.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel’s frown deepened. He walked over to a nearby table and sat down heavily, the paper bag still in his hands. Maisie joined him, watching as he carefully emptied the contents onto the table—**Chloe’s phone, a USB stick, and a folded Post-it note.**</p>
<p>Daniel unfolded the note and stared at the message, his expression tightening. <strong>&quot;Urgent, check my phone.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>His heart began to race as he picked up Chloe’s phone, but the screen lit up and immediately prompted him for a PIN. <strong>Face-ID had failed.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Do you know her PIN?&quot; Daniel asked, looking up at Maisie.</p>
<p>Maisie grinned, a glint of mischief in her eyes. &quot;No, but I bet I can guess it.&quot; She leaned over, quickly typing in four digits. The phone unlocked immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, too easy,&quot; she said triumphantly, handing the phone back to Daniel.</p>
<p>Daniel’s relief was short-lived. As soon as the phone unlocked, it opened straight to a note that Chloe had written. His eyes scanned the message quickly:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Just spotted Henry leaving the travel agent. I’m following him to see where he goes. Check the USB drive—it contains the final piece of the puzzle. If I’m not back soon, use my AirTag to find me.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Daniel’s stomach dropped. He passed the USB stick to Maisie without a word, his mind already racing through the possibilities. <strong>Why was Chloe following Henry? Where was she now?</strong></p>
<p>Maisie pulled out her laptop, which was still warm in her backpack. She quickly booted it up, inserting the USB drive. A few seconds later, a video file opened on the screen. Maisie’s eyes widened as she realised what she was looking at.</p>
<p>&quot;Er, Daniel,&quot; she said, her voice suddenly serious, &quot;You need to see this.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel leaned forward, his eyes fixed on the screen. <strong>There was Henry, backstage at the Christmas lights ceremony, injecting something into the mayor’s water bottle.</strong></p>
<p>Daniel’s heart pounded. He clapped his hands once, the sound echoing in the quiet café. &quot;We’ve got him!&quot; he said, his voice filled with an intensity that surprised even Maisie. &quot;We finally have everything we need.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie sat back in her chair, shaking her head in disbelief. &quot;I can’t believe it… This is the final piece.&quot;</p>
<p>But even as the satisfaction of having cracked the case settled over them, there was a gnawing worry at the back of Daniel’s mind. <strong>Where was Chloe? And why hadn’t she come back yet?</strong></p>
<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<p>Daniel sat at the café table, staring at Chloe’s phone. <strong>The AirTag was at the lighthouse</strong>. He frowned, tapping his temples lightly as his mind raced through possibilities. <strong>Why the lighthouse?</strong> If Henry was getting ready to flee the country, surely the airport or docks would make more sense. Something about this felt off.</p>
<p>He opened the <strong>Find My</strong> app again, staring at the blinking dot on the screen. His fingers drummed against the edge of the phone. <strong>What are you doing at the lighthouse, Henry?</strong> His mind darted from possibility to possibility, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that didn’t quite fit.</p>
<p>Then his phone buzzed in his pocket, startling him. It vibrated softly, its familiar pulse reminding him that he always kept the ringer off—the noise was too distracting.</p>
<p>He glanced at the screen, debating whether to answer. <strong>Unknown number.</strong> He let it buzz until the call stopped, his thoughts still focused on the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Then the phone buzzed again.</p>
<p>Daniel sighed, pulling it out of his pocket. <strong>Same number.</strong> Something tickled at the back of his mind. He recognised it. His brain worked quickly, sorting through the details, a mental Rolodex flipping through everything he’d seen and heard recently. <strong>Henry.</strong></p>
<p>It was Henry Davenport’s number. Daniel’s pulse quickened.</p>
<p>Why would Henry be calling him? Daniel’s fingers hovered over the <strong>Decline</strong> button, tempted to let it go to voicemail again. But something told him to answer.</p>
<p>He tapped the screen and brought the phone to his ear. “Hello, Henry.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, then Henry’s voice, slick and mocking, came through. “**Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.** Always the clever one. But maybe not as clever as you think, eh?”</p>
<p>Daniel stiffened. “What do you want, Henry?”</p>
<p>Henry chuckled softly, a sinister edge to the sound. “Straight to the point. I like that about you. Here’s the deal: you’ve got something I want. That little USB drive with the footage on it. How about we make a trade?”</p>
<p>Daniel’s mind raced, his hands instinctively going to his temples as he processed the information. <strong>A trade? What could Henry possibly have that I want?</strong></p>
<p>“I’m not interested in anything you have,” Daniel replied, his voice steady. “I’ll just take the footage to the police.”</p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk, Daniel.” Henry’s voice was patronising, dripping with disdain. “You didn’t even ask what I’m offering. Not very smart of you.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s breath caught in his throat. He knew this was a game, but Henry was unpredictable. His fingers tapped against his temple again, a quick, rhythmic beat. <strong>What does Henry have? What’s his leverage?</strong></p>
<p>“Fine,” Daniel said through gritted teeth. “What are you offering?”</p>
<p>Henry let the silence stretch for a moment, clearly enjoying the power shift. “Let’s see… How about something you care about? A certain young lady by the name of Chloe?”</p>
<p>Daniel’s heart lurched. For a moment, his mind went completely blank, the thoughts scattered like a deck of cards thrown into the air. Chloe—**Henry had Chloe**.</p>
<p>“If you hurt her—” Daniel’s voice cracked with a rare hint of emotion, his mind grappling with the weight of the situation.</p>
<p>“Calm down, calm down,” Henry said, his tone suddenly cold. “No need for threats. I have no intention of hurting her. But I do need that USB drive, Daniel. And if you don’t bring it to me—well, accidents happen. People can slip, especially from high places. Like the lighthouse gallery, for instance.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s grip tightened on the phone, his mind racing faster than ever. <strong>The lighthouse.</strong> The gallery deck was high—dangerously high. His vision blurred slightly as his fingers tapped frantically against his temples, trying to think. <strong>Think. Think.</strong></p>
<p>“I’m at the lighthouse now,” Henry continued, his voice oozing with smugness. “Bring the USB drive. And Daniel? Come alone. If I see anyone else, Chloe might not have the best view of the ocean when she slips off the gallery.”</p>
<p>The line went dead.</p>
<p>Daniel stared at the phone, the dial tone buzzing faintly in his ear. His chest tightened, panic rising in the back of his throat. He didn’t panic—he couldn’t afford to panic—but the thought of Chloe in danger clawed at his composure. <strong>He needed to think.</strong></p>
<p>“Everything alright?” Maisie’s voice broke through his spiral of thoughts, pulling him back to the moment.</p>
<p>Daniel shook his head, tapping his temples more urgently now, his thoughts whirling in too many directions at once. “No… no, it’s not alright,” he said quietly, more to himself than to Maisie.</p>
<p>She took a step closer, concern written all over her face. “What’s happened?”</p>
<p>His breath came faster, but he forced himself to slow it down, to focus. <strong>Tap. Tap. Tap.</strong> He could think through this. He had to think through this.</p>
<p>“Henry,” he muttered, finally looking up at Maisie. “He has Chloe. He wants the USB drive in exchange. He’s at the lighthouse.”</p>
<p>Maisie’s eyes widened. “What? We have to tell the police—”</p>
<p>Daniel held up a hand, his fingers stilling. “No,” he said, more firmly than she expected. “Henry said I have to come alone. If I don’t, he’ll… he’ll push her off the gallery.”</p>
<p>Maisie’s face paled. She opened her mouth to say something, but Daniel was already lost in thought again, his mind racing through every possible move.</p>
<p>He needed a plan—a logical plan. There was no room for error. He couldn’t lose Chloe, and he couldn’t let Henry get away.</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel knew he didn’t have much time. His heart pounded in his chest, but he forced himself to block out the rising panic. <strong>Focus.</strong> He tapped his temples, a steady rhythm to quiet the storm of thoughts that threatened to overwhelm him. Closing his eyes, he let his mind drift, running through different scenarios like puzzle pieces in his head.</p>
<p>Each scenario ended the same—Henry escaping or someone getting hurt. Over and over, his mind spun through the options, discarding each one with a surge of frustration. <strong>Too dangerous. Too unpredictable. Too risky.</strong></p>
<p>And then… <strong>there was one</strong>. A plan began to take shape, an idea that was risky but just might work. It was a long shot, but it was the best he had.</p>
<p>Daniel opened his eyes, his focus sharp and unwavering now. “Do you have a pen and paper?” he asked Maisie, his voice suddenly calm despite the storm raging in his mind.</p>
<p>Maisie blinked at him, her concern deepening, but she quickly rummaged through her backpack. She pulled out a small notebook and a pen, handing them to Daniel without a word. She knew better than to ask questions when he was in this mode—his mind racing far ahead, seeing connections she hadn’t even begun to consider.</p>
<p>Daniel flipped the notebook open to a blank page and began to write, his pen moving quickly but methodically. Every word, every instruction, had to be precise. He couldn’t afford any mistakes.</p>
<p>When he was done, he tore out the page, folded it neatly, and handed it to Maisie. &quot;Take this to Mrs Harding,&quot; he said, his voice firm, giving no room for argument. &quot;Make sure she gets it right away.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie looked at the folded note, then back at Daniel, her eyes wide with worry. &quot;Daniel, are you sure—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to go,&quot; Daniel interrupted, standing up abruptly. There was no time for second-guessing now.</p>
<p>He walked out of the café before Maisie could protest, his heart pounding harder with every step. As he headed down to the bus stop, he replayed the plan in his mind, over and over, each detail fitting together like the cogs of a clock. <strong>It has to work. It has to.</strong> But a nagging thought kept creeping back in—**too many things could go wrong.**</p>
<p>The bus pulled up with a hiss of brakes, and Daniel climbed aboard. He took a seat near the front, his hands gripping the edge of his seat as he stared out the window, the world rushing by in a blur. The plan played in his head again, faster this time, the possible outcomes swirling together.</p>
<p>If he miscalculated, if Henry was one step ahead… <strong>no.</strong> He couldn’t allow his mind to go there.</p>
<p>The bus rumbled to a stop. Daniel got off and looked toward the lighthouse, standing tall and solitary against the grey horizon. The dark clouds were rolling in quickly, thick and heavy, and a sharp wind whipped at his jacket. <strong>A storm was coming.</strong></p>
<p>He hesitated for only a moment, taking a deep breath to steel himself. Then, without a second thought, he started walking toward the lighthouse, his footsteps quickening as the first drops of rain splattered against the pavement.</p>
<p>The wind grew stronger as he neared the lighthouse, pushing against him with every step. Soon, he had to lean into the gusts, his clothes already soaked through. The icy rain chilled him to the bone, but Daniel hardly noticed. His mind was too focused, too intent on what lay ahead.</p>
<p>When he reached the base of the lighthouse, he glanced up toward the gallery deck. <strong>No one was there.</strong> The rain made it difficult to see, but the place seemed eerily quiet. <strong>Too quiet.</strong></p>
<p>He tapped his temples again, grounding himself as he ran through the plan one last time. The lighthouse loomed above him, its stone walls slick with rain, casting a shadow over the stormy sea. <strong>Henry was inside</strong>, probably hiding from the weather, waiting for Daniel to arrive.</p>
<p>Daniel’s stomach twisted. <strong>Henry wasn’t going to let them go</strong>—he’d realised that earlier, the cold certainty settling in like a stone in his chest. Henry wasn’t just after the USB drive. He needed to make sure that neither he nor Chloe were alive to tell the tale. <strong>This was a trap.</strong></p>
<p>Daniel swallowed hard, pushing down the fear that threatened to surface. He had to stick to the plan. He couldn’t let doubt creep in.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and pushed open the heavy door of the lighthouse. It creaked loudly, the sound echoing through the empty space inside. The air was damp and cold, and the dim light filtering through the windows made everything feel bleak and suffocating.</p>
<p>His footsteps echoed as he stepped inside, water dripping from his soaked clothes onto the stone floor. The narrow spiral staircase loomed ahead, winding its way up to the gallery. Daniel glanced upward but couldn’t see anyone. <strong>Henry must be waiting at the top.</strong></p>
<p>The stairs felt endless as he climbed, the metal steps cold under his hands as he gripped the railing. With each step, his mind raced, not just with the plan but with all the things that could go wrong. <strong>Henry was dangerous. He was unpredictable.</strong></p>
<p>His breath came harder as he reached the higher levels, the storm outside growing louder, the wind howling around the lighthouse like a warning. Daniel’s chest tightened with every step, but he forced himself to keep climbing. <strong>Chloe was up there.</strong></p>
<p>He finally reached the top. The gallery deck loomed ahead, the metal door leading to it slightly ajar. Daniel paused for a moment, his hand hovering over the door handle. He knew that once he stepped through that door, the real game would begin.</p>
<p><strong>One wrong move could cost them everything.</strong></p>
<p>But there was no time to hesitate. He gripped the handle tightly, took a deep breath, and pushed the door open.</p>
<p>The wind hit him full force as he stepped onto the gallery deck, the rain stinging his face. He blinked through the downpour, scanning the deck. And then, standing near the railing, silhouetted against the stormy sky, was Henry Davenport.</p>
<p>And next to him—Chloe. Bound, her eyes wide with fear, her body trembling in the wind.</p>
<p>Henry turned slowly, a twisted smile on his face. “You made it, Daniel,” he called over the roar of the wind. “I was starting to think you’d leave poor Chloe to fend for herself.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s heart hammered in his chest, but he didn’t respond. <strong>Now it was time for the plan.</strong></p>
<h2>Chapter 23</h2>
<p>Daniel&#39;s mind raced as he stared across the gallery deck at Henry, his eyes scanning the older man&#39;s face for any sign of weakness. His heart pounded in his chest like a trapped bird, but outwardly, he kept his voice calm and steady, a stark contrast to the turmoil within. &quot;You&#39;re running out of time, Henry,&quot; he said, his words measured and deliberate. &quot;There&#39;s a USB drive. It has all your offshore accounts, the entire money-laundering operation... <strong>everything</strong>. Every last dirty detail.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry frowned, his brow furrowing deeply as he began pacing back and forth across the polished wooden deck. His eyes narrowed with suspicion, darting between Daniel and the distant horizon. &quot;And where is this USB drive?&quot; he demanded, his voice gruff with barely contained anger and a hint of fear.</p>
<p>Daniel nodded slowly, carefully choosing his next words as if picking his way through a minefield. He knew the stakes were high, and one wrong move could spell disaster. &quot;It&#39;s in a locker at the train station,&quot; he revealed, watching Henry&#39;s reaction closely. &quot;I put it there for safekeeping. Mrs. Harding doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s on it. I&#39;ve created a text message that will be sent in two hours telling her exactly where it is. She&#39;ll take it straight to the police, no questions asked.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s frantic pacing came to an abrupt halt. His eyes, cold and filled with unbridled fury, locked onto Daniel with an intensity that could have melted steel. The air in the lighthouse grew thick with tension as Henry&#39;s voice cut through the silence like a knife. &quot;And what stops me from killing you both right now and finding that damned drive myself?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s face remained an impassive mask, betraying no hint of emotion or fear. His voice was steady and measured as he replied, &quot;If you kill us, you won&#39;t know which locker it&#39;s in. I could&#39;ve used any of the hundreds there. It&#39;s like finding a needle in a haystack. You also won&#39;t know the lock code, which is essential. And if the text goes out—&quot; Daniel deliberately let the sentence hang in the air, allowing the implications to sink in.</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s nostrils flared wildly, his mind racing through possibilities and scenarios at breakneck speed. In a sudden burst of frustration, he grabbed the back of the lighthouse railing, his fingers curling around the cold metal and squeezing until his knuckles turned a ghostly white. The veins in his neck pulsed visibly as he fought to control his rage. After a moment of tense silence, he spat out the words, &quot;What&#39;s the locker number?&quot;</p>
<p>Without missing a beat or showing any sign of hesitation, Daniel calmly provided the information. His voice was clear and unwavering as he stated, &quot;Locker 153, Platform 2. The code is 8246.&quot; The precision of his response hung in the air, a testament to his confidence and the high stakes of their confrontation.</p>
<p>Henry stared at Daniel, doubt flickering in his eyes. His jaw clenched and unclenched as he weighed his options. &quot;You could be lying,&quot; he said, his voice laced with suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;I could be,&quot; Daniel&#39;s voice was flat, calculated, devoid of any emotion that might betray his true intentions. His eyes remained fixed on Henry, unwavering. &quot;But if you don&#39;t hurry and get to the USB drive first, the police will have it and <strong>all</strong> your assets will be frozen. Every last penny, Henry. You&#39;ll have nowhere to run, no resources to fall back on.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry cursed under his breath, his face contorting with frustration and fear. He ran a hand through his disheveled hair, his mind racing. &quot;Fine,&quot; he spat, the word tasting bitter in his mouth. &quot;But if you&#39;re lying, I swear I&#39;ll make sure you regret it for the rest of your miserable life.&quot;</p>
<p>His gaze shifted toward Chloe, bound and silent at the edge of the gallery deck. The wind whipped her hair around her face, but her eyes remained defiant. Daniel&#39;s stomach tightened as Henry moved toward her, rope in hand. His fingers twitched, itching to intervene, but he forced himself to remain still. &quot;I could kill her right now,&quot; Henry threatened, his voice low and venomous, a cruel smile playing at the corners of his mouth. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll just throw her off the lighthouse. That&#39;ll buy me some time, won&#39;t it? And it&#39;ll be your fault, Daniel. All your fault.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s pulse quickened, his heart pounding against his ribcage, but he didn&#39;t let the fear show on his face. He kept his expression neutral, masking the anxiety that threatened to overwhelm him. &quot;If you kill us, you&#39;ll never find out if I told the truth about the locker,&quot; he said, his voice steady despite the tension in the air. &quot;You can take us with you, but that&#39;ll slow you down considerably. You&#39;ve got two hours to get that drive before Mrs. Harding knows where it is. Time is ticking away.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s lip curled in frustration, his mind working furiously to decide his next move. His eyes darted between Daniel and Chloe, weighing his options as beads of sweat formed on his brow. The internal struggle was evident on his face as he considered the risks and potential outcomes. He didn&#39;t trust Daniel, not for a second, but the risk of losing everything he had worked for was too great. He couldn&#39;t afford to waste precious time killing them now, not when the stakes were so high.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Henry growled, his voice rough with barely contained anger. He stepped toward Daniel, closing the distance between them in two quick strides. Without warning, he yanked Daniel&#39;s arms roughly behind his back, eliciting a small gasp of pain from the young man. Henry began tying him up with practiced efficiency, his movements quick and brutal. The rope bit into Daniel&#39;s wrists, the coarse fibers cutting into his skin as Henry worked the knots tightly, ensuring there was no chance of escape. Daniel winced but remained silent, knowing that any sign of weakness could be used against him.</p>
<p>Once Daniel was securely tied, Henry stepped back, breathing heavily, his face flushed with anger and exertion. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his hands clenched and unclenched at his sides. &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m letting you off easy,&quot; he snarled, his voice dripping with venom. &quot;When I get back, this will be the end for both of you. You&#39;ll wish you&#39;d never set foot in Seabourne.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel said nothing, keeping his face carefully blank, his blue eyes meeting Henry&#39;s without flinching. He let Henry believe he still had the upper hand, knowing that showing any emotion now would only fuel the man&#39;s rage further.</p>
<p>Henry gave them one last, hateful glance, his eyes narrowed to slits as he surveyed his handiwork. Satisfied that they were securely bound, he turned on his heel and stormed down the spiral staircase. His heavy boots clattered against the metal steps, the sound echoing through the lighthouse like angry thunder. The noise faded as he descended, leaving Daniel and Chloe alone in the oppressive silence of the lighthouse tower.</p>
<hr>
<p>Henry Davenport thundered down the lighthouse stairs, his footsteps echoing off the cold stone walls. His breath came in ragged gasps, a mixture of exertion and unbridled fury. The spiral staircase seemed endless, each turn revealing another set of steps stretching out before him.</p>
<p>As he descended, the howling wind outside grew louder, penetrating the thick walls of the lighthouse. The storm raged on, rain lashing against the windows in angry sheets. The tempest outside mirrored the turmoil in Henry&#39;s mind, his thoughts a whirlwind of anger and frustration.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, his jaw clenched so tight it ached. Daniel had outmaneuvered him, buying precious time with his clever words. The thought of being outsmarted by that meddlesome young man made Henry&#39;s blood boil. He&#39;d been so close to getting away with everything, and now his carefully laid plans were unraveling before his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;That little brat,&quot; Henry muttered under his breath, his voice barely audible over the storm and his own heavy footfalls. &quot;He thinks he&#39;s so clever. When I get back, he&#39;ll regret ever crossing me.&quot;</p>
<p>The promise of retribution was the only thing keeping Henry&#39;s rising panic at bay. He needed to focus, to push aside the anger and think clearly. Time was of the essence now, and every second counted.</p>
<p>As Henry neared the bottom of the staircase, the sound of the storm grew even louder. The wind howled through the cracks in the old lighthouse door, a haunting melody that sent a chill down his spine. Rain pelted against the building, creating a constant, thunderous backdrop to his racing thoughts.</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s mind raced with possibilities and consequences. If Daniel was telling the truth about the USB drive, he needed to act fast. But if it was a lie... The thought made his stomach churn with a mixture of fear and rage.</p>
<p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Henry&#39;s feet hit the solid ground of the lighthouse&#39;s bottom floor. He paused for a moment, catching his breath and steeling himself for what lay ahead.</p>
<p>Henry grabbed a heavy coat hanging near the lighthouse entrance and hastily put it on, his movements jerky and frantic. The rough wool scratched against his skin, but he barely noticed, his mind consumed with thoughts of escape.</p>
<p>With a deep breath, Henry reached for the door handle, his fingers trembling slightly. He hesitated for a split second, then wrenched the door open. A gust of wind and rain immediately assaulted him, nearly knocking him off balance.</p>
<p>Stepping outside, Henry squinted against the downpour, his eyes struggling to adjust to the darkness. But as he blinked away the raindrops, his heart sank. The night was illuminated by flashing red and blue lights, cutting through the gloom like angry, accusing fingers.</p>
<p>Police cars surrounded the lighthouse, their sirens silent but lights blazing. Officers stood at the ready, their faces grim and determined. Henry&#39;s mind raced, searching for an escape route, but he knew it was futile. He was trapped.</p>
<p>From the sea of uniforms, a familiar figure stepped forward. Inspector Haversham approached Henry, his expression a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment. The Inspector&#39;s coat billowed in the wind as he closed the distance between them.</p>
<p>&quot;Henry Davenport,&quot; Inspector Haversham&#39;s voice carried over the howling wind, &quot;you&#39;re under arrest for money laundering and the murder of Mayor Pompington.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry&#39;s shoulders slumped in defeat as the Inspector recited his rights. The words washed over him, barely registering in his shock-numbed mind. He offered no resistance as Haversham firmly grasped his arm and led him towards one of the waiting police cars.</p>
<p>The short walk felt like an eternity to Henry. Rain pelted his face, mingling with the sweat of fear and exertion. The flashing lights seemed to mock him, a stark reminder of how spectacularly his plans had fallen apart.</p>
<p>As they reached the car, Inspector Haversham opened the rear door. With a firm hand on Henry&#39;s head, he guided him into the backseat. Henry barely had time to settle before Haversham slammed the car door shut behind him, the sound echoing with a sense of finality.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chloe turned to Daniel, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and hope. &quot;How are we going to escape?&quot; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s face remained calm, a stark contrast to the tension in the air. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; he said softly, &quot;it&#39;s all part of my plan.&quot;</p>
<p>As the words left his mouth, Daniel&#39;s mind raced. He silently hoped that his carefully orchestrated plan had worked. Had Maisie delivered the note as he&#39;d asked? Did his text reach Mrs. Harding in time? And if it did, had Mrs. Harding contacted Inspector Haversham? Most importantly, had Inspector Haversham acted on the information about Henry?</p>
<p>The seconds ticked by, each moment feeling like an eternity. Daniel&#39;s heart pounded in his chest, the only outward sign of his inner turmoil.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door burst open. Maisie rushed in, her face flushed and her eyes brimming with tears. Without a word, she hurried to untie them, her hands shaking as she worked on the knots.</p>
<p>As the ropes fell away, Daniel noticed Maisie&#39;s tears. Confusion clouded his features. Why was Maisie crying? Had something gone wrong? His mind struggled to process the conflicting signals.</p>
<p>Before he could voice his concerns, Maisie and Chloe burst into laughter. They playfully punched Daniel&#39;s arms, their relief palpable in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Daniel,&quot; Chloe said, wiping away a tear of her own, &quot;Maisie&#39;s crying because she&#39;s happy. We&#39;re safe!&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel blinked, processing this information. He hadn&#39;t considered that tears could be a sign of joy. A small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as understanding dawned.</p>
<h2>Chapter 24</h2>
<p>Daniel stepped out of the lighthouse, his eyes squinting against the harsh wind and rain. He absently rubbed at his wrists, wincing slightly as his fingers traced the angry red marks left by the ropes. The storm raged around him, but he barely noticed, his mind still processing the events that had just unfolded.</p>
<p>A moment later, Chloe and Maisie emerged from the lighthouse, their hair immediately whipping around their faces in the fierce gale. Chloe placed a gentle hand on Daniel&#39;s shoulder, offering silent support as they stood together in the tempest.</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s gaze was drawn to the road leading away from the lighthouse. Through the sheets of rain, he could just make out the fading red and blue lights of the police cars as they disappeared into the distance. A mix of relief and disbelief washed over him as he watched the last traces of Henry Davenport vanish from sight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a familiar figure hurried towards them through the downpour. Mrs. Harding, her coat pulled tight around her, rushed up to the trio. Without hesitation, she enveloped them all in a fierce hug, her warmth a stark contrast to the cold rain pelting them.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, you three,&quot; Mrs. Harding said, her voice barely audible over the howling wind. &quot;Let&#39;s get you out of this storm and into the car.&quot;</p>
<p>She ushered them towards a nearby vehicle, opening the doors and making sure they were all safely inside before climbing in herself. As soon as the doors closed, shutting out the fury of the storm, Mrs. Harding reached for the controls and turned on the heating.</p>
<p>Warm air began to circulate through the car, bringing with it a sense of comfort and safety. Daniel, Chloe, and Maisie huddled together in the backseat, their wet clothes clinging to their skin as they slowly began to thaw.</p>
<p>The car wound its way through the rain-slicked streets of Seabourne, windshield wipers working overtime against the deluge. Inside, Mrs. Harding gripped the steering wheel tightly, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. In the backseat, Daniel, Chloe, and Maisie huddled together, their wet clothes slowly drying in the warmth of the car&#39;s heater.</p>
<p>No one spoke during the drive. The only sounds were the patter of rain on the roof and the occasional rumble of thunder in the distance. Each passenger seemed lost in their own thoughts, processing the events that had just transpired at the lighthouse.</p>
<p>As they pulled up to Mrs. Harding&#39;s house, the rain began to ease slightly. They hurried inside, grateful to be out of the storm. Mrs. Harding ushered them towards the kitchen, where the aroma of fresh pizza filled the air.</p>
<p>&quot;I ordered this earlier,&quot; she said, gesturing to the boxes on the counter. &quot;I thought you might be hungry after... everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, Chloe, and Maisie settled around the kitchen table, their bodies still tense from the ordeal. They began to eat mechanically, the warm food providing a much-needed comfort. Mrs. Harding busied herself in the kitchen for a few moments before joining them at the table.</p>
<p>As they ate, the silence gradually began to lift. Maisie picked at her slice of pizza, her eyes darting between Daniel and Chloe. Mrs. Harding cleared her throat, drawing their attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Maisie,&quot; she said gently, &quot;I&#39;ve spoken with your father. He agrees that it&#39;s best for you to stay here tonight, given the circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie nodded, relief evident on her face. &quot;Thanks, Mrs. Harding,&quot; she mumbled around a mouthful of pizza.</p>
<p>As they continued to eat, the tension in the room slowly began to dissipate. Suddenly, Daniel cleared his throat, a mischievous glint in his eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I guess you could say Henry&#39;s plans really went off a cliff,&quot; he said, his lips twitching into an unexpected smile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding, Chloe, and Maisie all turned to stare at him, their expressions a mix of shock and disbelief. Daniel Turner, the normally serious and focused young man, had just made a joke about their harrowing experience.</p>
<p>For a moment, silence reigned. Then, as if a dam had broken, laughter erupted around the table. It started as a giggle from Maisie, then spread to Chloe, who let out a snort before dissolving into full-blown laughter. Even Mrs. Harding couldn&#39;t resist, her shoulders shaking as she chuckled.</p>
<p>Daniel, surprised by their reaction, found himself joining in, his own laughter mixing with theirs. The sound filled the kitchen, a cathartic release after the tension of the past few hours.</p>
<p>As their laughter subsided, Chloe wiped a tear from her eye and turned to Daniel. &quot;That was... unexpected,&quot; she said, still grinning. &quot;But Daniel, how did you know your plan would work? You seemed so calm up there in the lighthouse.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel&#39;s smile faded slightly as he considered her question. He set down his half-eaten slice of pizza and met Chloe&#39;s gaze. &quot;I didn&#39;t know,&quot; he admitted quietly. &quot;To be honest, there was a moment when I thought Henry might actually throw us off the lighthouse.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened at his confession. &quot;Really? But you seemed so composed during the whole encounter. I was impressed by how you handled it.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged, a faint blush coloring his cheeks at her praise. &quot;I just knew I had to keep him talking, to buy time. I hoped that if I could keep him distracted long enough, the plan would work.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding smiled at Chloe and Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good plan Daniel,&quot; she said. &quot;You played against Henry&#39;s weakness - greed.&quot;</p>
<p>Then she turned to Maisie. &quot;If you hadn&#39;t been so insistent that I read Henry&#39;s note then things may have turned out very different.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie blushed, ducking her head slightly as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding continued: &quot;You did good, Daniel. Henry Davenport will probably spend the rest of his life behind bars. And Mrs. Pompington has been released. Well done.&quot;</p>
<p>A collective sigh of relief seemed to pass through the room. Daniel&#39;s shoulders relaxed visibly, as if a great weight had been lifted from them. Chloe reached out and squeezed his hand, a proud smile playing on her lips.</p>
<p>Maisie, still flushed from Mrs. Harding&#39;s praise, spoke up. &quot;So, it&#39;s really over? We actually solved a murder case?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding nodded, her eyes twinkling. &quot;Indeed you did. All three of you played crucial roles in unraveling this mystery. It&#39;s not every day that a group of young people manage to outsmart a seasoned criminal like Henry Davenport.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel, who had been quiet, finally spoke. &quot;I couldn&#39;t have done it without Chloe and Maisie,&quot; he said, his voice soft but firm. &quot;Chloe&#39;s intuition and Maisie&#39;s tech skills were invaluable. We make a good team.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe beamed at his words, while Maisie&#39;s blush deepened. Mrs. Harding looked at each of them in turn, her expression a mix of pride and concern.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve all shown remarkable courage and intelligence,&quot; she said. &quot;But remember, what you&#39;ve been through is not something to be taken lightly. It&#39;s okay if you need time to process everything that&#39;s happened.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Daniel, Chloe, and Maisie sat on a bench in the market square, watching as the town&#39;s residents gradually filled the open space. The air buzzed with excitement, a stark contrast to the tension that had gripped Seabourne just days ago. Fairy lights twinkled overhead, strung between lampposts and trees, waiting for the main event.</p>
<p>As the crowd grew, Daniel fidgeted slightly, his eyes darting from face to face. Chloe noticed his unease and gently placed her hand on his arm, offering a reassuring smile. Maisie, on the other hand, couldn&#39;t contain her enthusiasm, practically bouncing in her seat as she waved to familiar faces in the crowd.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the square as Mrs. Pompington walked onto the stage, her heels clicking against the wooden planks. She approached the podium with measured steps, her posture straight and confident. The trio watched intently as she adjusted the microphone and reached for the glass of water placed nearby.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington&#39;s eyes found them in the crowd, and a warm smile spread across her face. She raised the glass in their direction before taking a sip. &quot;Hope this one isn&#39;t poisoned,&quot; she quipped, eliciting a mixture of gasps and nervous laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>Daniel tensed at the joke, but Chloe squeezed his arm gently, reminding him that it was all over now. Maisie, caught off guard by the bold comment, let out a surprised giggle.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington then launched into a brief speech, her voice carrying clearly across the square. She spoke of community, resilience, and the bright future ahead for Seabourne. As she talked, Daniel, Chloe, and Maisie exchanged glances, silently acknowledging their role in ensuring that future.</p>
<p>With her speech concluded, Mrs. Pompington made her way to the large switch positioned at the side of the stage. The crowd held its collective breath as she reached for it. With a dramatic flourish, she pulled the lever down.</p>
<hr>
<p>As the lights of the Christmas tree illuminated the square, casting a warm glow over the gathered crowd, Rosie&#39;s Café became a haven of celebration. The cozy interior buzzed with excited chatter as Daniel, Chloe, Maisie, Mrs. Harding, and Mrs. Pompington gathered for a small, intimate party.</p>
<p>Rosie had outdone herself, transforming the café into a festive wonderland. Twinkling fairy lights adorned the windows, and the aroma of freshly baked mince pies and mulled wine filled the air. The group settled into the comfortable chairs, the tension of the past weeks finally beginning to dissipate.</p>
<p>Daniel sat in a corner, nursing a cup of hot chocolate, his eyes darting around the room as he tried to process the events that had led to this moment. Chloe and Maisie were engrossed in animated conversation with Rosie, their laughter punctuating the gentle hum of Christmas music playing in the background.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington, looking more relaxed than Daniel had ever seen her, excused herself from a conversation with Mrs. Harding and made her way towards him. As she approached, Daniel felt a knot form in his stomach, the guilt he&#39;d been carrying bubbling to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Pompington,&quot; Daniel began, his voice barely above a whisper, &quot;I wanted to apologize for getting you locked up. I made a terrible mistake, and I&#39;m truly sorry for the trouble I caused you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pompington&#39;s expression softened as she took a seat beside him. &quot;Daniel,&quot; she said, her voice warm and reassuring, &quot;you have absolutely nothing to apologize for. In fact, I owe you a debt of gratitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel looked up, surprise etched across his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Henry Davenport was a master manipulator,&quot; Mrs. Pompington continued, her eyes narrowing slightly at the mention of his name. &quot;He ran a huge money laundering empire right under our noses, and he nearly got away with it. But you, Daniel, you should hold your head up high because it was you who caught him.&quot;</p>
<p>Later in the evening, Daniel, Chloe, and Maisie found themselves seated at a small table near the window. The soft glow of the café&#39;s lights reflected off the frosted glass, creating a cozy atmosphere that contrasted sharply with the tension they&#39;d experienced over the past weeks.</p>
<p>Maisie, her eyes sparkling with excitement, leaned forward and asked, &quot;So, Daniel, are you going to become a detective now? You were brilliant solving this case!&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel let out a snort, shaking his head vigorously. He set down his mug of hot chocolate and looked at Maisie and Chloe with a wry smile. &quot;To be honest, I never want to hear about another crime, never mind investigate one,&quot; he said firmly.</p>
<p>Chloe raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement playing at the corners of her mouth. &quot;Really? After all we&#39;ve been through?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel nodded emphatically. &quot;Really. I&#39;m quite content to go back to my woodworking and leave the crime-solving to the professionals.&quot;</p>
<p>Maisie looked slightly disappointed, but Chloe nodded understandingly. She knew how taxing the investigation had been on Daniel, both emotionally and mentally.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Maisie said with a grin, &quot;at least we can say we solved one big mystery. That&#39;s more than most people can claim!&quot;</p>
<p>The three friends laughed, the sound mingling with the cheerful chatter around them. As they settled into a comfortable silence, each lost in their own thoughts, the weight of their recent adventure seemed to lift, replaced by a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie.</p>
