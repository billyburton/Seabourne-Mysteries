Background: Chloe also lives in the same independently owned home as Daniel. She came to Seabourne after a difficult childhood in the city, where her neurodivergence was misunderstood and dismissed. In Seabourne, she has found a place where she can thrive, and she quickly formed a close bond with Daniel, recognizing in him a kindred spirit.

Personality: Chloe is empathetic and intuitive, often understanding people’s emotions and motivations better than they do themselves. She is patient, kind, and fiercely protective of Daniel, using her social skills to help him navigate interactions that he finds challenging. Despite her own difficulties, she has a natural ability to connect with others and can often smooth over situations that could escalate.

Strengths:

Emotional Intelligence: Chloe excels at reading people and understanding their emotions, which complements Daniel's logical approach. She can often predict how someone might react or what they might be hiding.

Creative Problem-Solving: Unlike Daniel's logical approach, Chloe thinks creatively and can come up with unconventional solutions to problems.

Resilience: Her difficult past has made her strong and resourceful, able to handle challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude.

Weaknesses:

Overwhelmed by Sensory Input: Chloe is highly sensitive to loud noises, bright lights, and crowded places, which can sometimes cause her to feel overwhelmed and anxious.

Anxiety: She struggles with anxiety, especially in unfamiliar situations or when things don’t go as planned. However, she has learned coping mechanisms and often relies on Daniel for support when she feels anxious.

Tendency to Avoid Conflict: Chloe dislikes confrontation and may avoid difficult conversations, which can sometimes lead to unresolved issues or misunderstandings.

Appearance: Chloe has shoulder-length auburn hair, often tied back in a ponytail. She has warm brown eyes that are quick to show her emotions. Chloe dresses in layers—soft sweaters, scarves, and comfortable boots—favoring earthy tones that reflect her grounded nature.

Hobbies:

Photography: Chloe has a keen eye for capturing beauty in the everyday. She often carries a camera with her, taking pictures of the town, the sea, and moments that strike her as meaningful. Her photography sometimes provides clues in their investigations.

Gardening: Chloe finds solace in tending to plants. The small garden at the home where she and Daniel live is her pride and joy, and she uses it as a space to relax and think.
