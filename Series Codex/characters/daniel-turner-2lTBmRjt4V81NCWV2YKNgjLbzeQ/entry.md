Background: Daniel grew up in Seabourne, living with his parents until they realized he would thrive better in a supportive community. He now resides in an independently owned home that caters to people who are neurodivergent. This home is a sanctuary for him, offering both structure and the freedom to explore his interests, particularly woodturning.

Personality: Daniel is highly intelligent with an extraordinary ability to notice details that others overlook. He is logical and methodical, often seeing patterns and connections where others see chaos. However, he struggles with social cues and picking up on others' emotions, which can make him seem distant or awkward in social situations. His frustration with communication barriers sometimes leads to moments of intense focus or withdrawal.

Strengths:

Exceptional Observational Skills: Daniel has an uncanny ability to spot minute details, whether it’s a tiny scratch on a door or the subtle shift in someone’s behavior.

Logical Mind: His ability to process information logically and connect disparate pieces of evidence allows him to solve complex puzzles that baffle others.

Woodworking Expertise: Through his passion for woodturning, Daniel has developed a deep understanding of materials and tools, which often plays a crucial role in his investigations.

Weaknesses:

Difficulty Communicating: Daniel often struggles to express his thoughts and feelings, especially in stressful situations. He sometimes resorts to nonverbal cues or his assistant to help convey his ideas.

Social Awkwardness: He finds it challenging to navigate social situations and often misunderstands others' emotions or intentions, which can lead to misunderstandings.

Rigid Thinking: His logical approach can sometimes make it difficult for him to think outside the box or understand actions driven purely by emotion.

Appearance: Daniel has a slender build, with sandy brown hair that is often slightly tousled. His intense blue eyes give away the sharp mind behind them, and he usually dresses in comfortable, practical clothing—jeans, flannel shirts, and sturdy shoes.

Hobbies:

Woodturning: Daniel spends a lot of time in the Seabourne Craft Workshop, creating beautiful and intricate wooden objects. This hobby helps him focus and relax, and often provides insights during his investigations.

Puzzles and Games: He enjoys solving puzzles, particularly those involving logic or patterns. This hobby complements his detective work, as it keeps his mind sharp and alert.
