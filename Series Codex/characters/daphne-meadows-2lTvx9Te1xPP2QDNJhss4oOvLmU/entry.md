Role: A retired schoolteacher and local historian.

Background: Daphne Meadows is a well-respected figure in Seabourne, having taught at the local school for over 40 years before retiring. She now spends her time researching and documenting the town’s history, and she’s written several books on the subject. Daphne is known for her sharp mind and even sharper tongue, but she has a soft spot for those who show genuine interest in learning. She’s a widow with no children, but she’s considered the unofficial “aunt” of the town, always ready to share her knowledge and stories.

Personality: Daphne is intelligent, fiercely independent, and has little patience for foolishness. She’s direct in her speech and doesn’t sugarcoat her opinions, but she’s also fair and kind to those who earn her respect. Daphne is a repository of local history, and she takes great pride in preserving the town’s heritage. She’s a keen observer of human nature, often seeing through people’s pretenses with ease. Despite her age, Daphne remains active, both mentally and physically, and is always up for a good mystery.

Physical Description: Daphne is tall and thin, with silver hair she wears in a neat bun. She has sharp, intelligent eyes behind a pair of reading glasses that she’s constantly misplacing. Her clothing is practical yet elegant, often consisting of a tweed skirt, a blouse, and a cardigan. She always carries a large leather handbag, which contains everything from books to snacks.

Role in the Series: Daphne provides invaluable historical context for the mysteries Daniel and Chloe investigate. Her knowledge of Seabourne’s past often uncovers crucial connections and motives. She also serves as a mentor to both Daniel and Chloe, offering wisdom and guidance when they face particularly challenging cases.
