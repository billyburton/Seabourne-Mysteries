Role: The owner of the general store in Seabourne.

Background: Eddie is a lifelong resident of Seabourne and runs the general store that’s been in his family for generations. The store is a vital part of the community, supplying everything from groceries to fishing tackle. Eddie is known for his encyclopedic knowledge of the town and its residents—if you need to know something, Eddie is the man to ask. He’s a widower with two grown children who have moved away, leaving him to run the store on his own.

Personality: Eddie is affable, chatty, and has an infectious laugh that echoes through the store. He’s the kind of person who knows everyone’s name and remembers their favorite items. Eddie loves a good story and is always willing to share a piece of town lore or a bit of gossip. Beneath his friendly demeanor, Eddie is observant and sharp, and he’s seen more than a few strange things in his time. He’s deeply loyal to Seabourne and its people, always ready to lend a hand.

Physical Description: Eddie is a stocky man with a round face and a full head of graying hair. He wears glasses perched on the end of his nose and often sports a colorful sweater vest over a button-down shirt. His hands are thick and calloused from years of working in the store, and he has a welcoming smile that makes customers feel at home.

Role in the Series: Eddie serves as a repository of local knowledge and a source of vital information. He often provides Daniel and Chloe with useful tidbits that help them piece together clues. His store is also a place where townsfolk gather, making it a hub of activity and gossip that sometimes leads to key discoveries.
