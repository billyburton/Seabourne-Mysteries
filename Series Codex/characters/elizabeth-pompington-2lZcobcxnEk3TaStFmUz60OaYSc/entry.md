Occupation: Retired Teacher

Appearance:

Height: 5'6"

Build: Slightly plump, with a gentle, matronly appearance.

Hair: Silver-gray, always neatly styled, often in a soft chignon.

Eyes: Pale blue, with a tendency to reveal her emotions despite her attempts to keep them guarded.

Style: Margaret dresses conservatively, favoring classic, tailored clothing in muted colors. She often wears pearls, a nod to her traditional values and upbringing.

Personality:

Public Demeanor: Margaret presents herself as a reserved, composed, and dignified woman. She has long played the role of the supportive wife, standing by her husband’s side throughout his career. In public, she is gracious and polite, if somewhat distant.

Private Self: Beneath her composed exterior, Margaret is a woman of deep emotions and hidden resentments. She often feels overlooked and underappreciated, both in her marriage and by the Seabourne community. Her marriage to Reginald was more of a partnership than a love match, and she has harbored regrets about the life she could have had.

Intelligence and Awareness: Margaret is highly intelligent and perceptive. She is a keen observer of people and has always been aware of the political undercurrents in Seabourne, even if she pretends to remain above the fray. She is also a repository of local gossip, knowing more about the town’s secrets than most realize.

Background:

Family: Margaret comes from an old, respectable Seabourne family, the Everlys, who have lived in the town for generations. She was raised with strong traditional values, which she carried into her marriage. Her family’s legacy is important to her, and she has always seen herself as a keeper of that legacy.

Marriage: Margaret married Reginald Pompington in her early 20s. Theirs was a marriage of convenience, solidified by social expectations rather than deep passion. Over the years, she supported Reginald’s ambitions, though she often felt sidelined by his political life. Their relationship was cordial but lacked warmth, and Margaret sometimes resented the sacrifices she made for his career.

Children: Margaret and Reginald had one child, a daughter named Amelia, who is now in her 30s and lives in London. Amelia and Margaret have a strained relationship, with Amelia seeing her mother as distant and controlling.

Key Traits:

Pride: Margaret is proud of her family’s history and her role as the mayor’s wife. However, this pride often manifests as rigidity and a reluctance to accept change, both in herself and in the town.

Resentment: She harbors deep-seated resentment, particularly toward her late husband, for the life she feels she was forced into. This resentment has only grown since his death, especially as she starts to uncover secrets he kept from her.

Loyalty: Despite her grievances, Margaret is fiercely loyal to her family and her late husband’s memory, at least publicly. She is determined to maintain the Pompington name’s reputation, even as she grapples with the truth about Reginald’s actions.

Backstory/Secrets:

Secret Romance: Years ago, before she married Reginald, Margaret had a brief but intense romance with another man, someone from a different social class. She ended the relationship under pressure from her family, who disapproved. This lost love is something she has never fully moved on from, and she occasionally wonders how different her life might have been.

Awareness of Reginald’s Affairs: Margaret was aware that Reginald had a few discreet affairs over the years. She turned a blind eye, rationalizing that it was the price of their social standing. However, she is beginning to suspect that one of these affairs may have been more serious and could have had significant implications for his death.

Financial Troubles: Unbeknownst to the public, Margaret has discovered that Reginald was involved in some dubious financial
