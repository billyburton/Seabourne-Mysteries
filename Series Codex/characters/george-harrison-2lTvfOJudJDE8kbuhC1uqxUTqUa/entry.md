Role: The owner of the Seabourne Craft Workshop and Daniel’s woodturning mentor.

Background: George, or Georgie as he’s affectionately known, is a lifelong resident of Seabourne. A master woodturner, he’s been running the workshop for decades, teaching generations of Seabourne residents the art of working with wood. Georgie is semi-retired, but he still spends most of his days in the workshop, either working on his own projects or guiding younger artisans. He’s a widower, with his wife having passed away several years ago, and has no children, making the workshop his legacy.

Personality: Georgie is calm, patient, and has a deep, almost meditative love for his craft. He’s seen as a wise elder in the community, someone who’s always willing to listen and offer advice. He’s gentle with his words but firm in his principles, and he has a knack for helping people see the bigger picture. Georgie is also deeply curious, always eager to learn new things, even in his later years. His sense of humor is subtle but sharp, and he enjoys sparring with Daniel over the finer points of woodworking.

Physical Description: Tall and lean, Georgie has a wiry strength that belies his age. His hair is white and thinning, often covered by a well-worn cap, and his hands are rough and calloused from years of working with wood. He usually wears work clothes—sturdy trousers, a flannel shirt, and an apron covered in wood shavings.

Role in the Series: Georgie is a mentor figure for Daniel, offering not only technical advice on woodturning but also life wisdom. He provides a grounding presence in Daniel’s life, helping him think through problems, both personal and professional. Georgie’s workshop also serves as a secondary setting for key scenes, where important conversations and revelations often occur.
