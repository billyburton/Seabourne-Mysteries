Occupation: Local business owner and former council member

Background: Henry Davenport has lived in Seabourne for most of his life. He comes from a well-established local family and owns a small chain of grocery stores in the region. Henry had previously served on the town council and had ambitions of becoming mayor himself. However, he lost to Reggie Pompington in the last mayoral election, a defeat that he never fully accepted. Since then, Henry has harbored a grudge, feeling that Reggieâ€™s popularity and charisma unfairly overshadowed his own more methodical and practical approach to leadership.
