Role: The local police inspector.

Background: Inspector Haversham was born and raised in Seabourne, leaving only briefly to attend the police academy. He’s a capable and dedicated officer, but he’s also pragmatic and knows the limits of his resources in a small town. Haversham is well-liked in the community, though he sometimes feels overshadowed by the more glamorous cases his colleagues handle in the city. He has a good working relationship with Daniel and Chloe, though their involvement in cases occasionally frustrates him.

Personality: Inspector Haversham is straightforward and down-to-earth, with a dry sense of humor. He’s a bit of a skeptic, particularly when it comes to anything outside the realm of hard evidence, but he respects Daniel’s abilities, even if he doesn’t always understand them. Haversham is diligent, sometimes to the point of being a workaholic, but he has a soft spot for his elderly mother, whom he visits every Sunday for lunch.

Physical Description: Haversham is of medium height and build, with a slightly receding hairline and dark brown hair that’s starting to gray at the temples. He has a rugged, square-jawed face, often set in a serious expression. His standard attire is a well-worn suit, usually with the tie slightly askew, and a trench coat that’s seen better days.

Role in the Series: Inspector Haversham is the official face of law and order in Seabourne, often collaborating with Daniel and Chloe on cases. He serves as a foil to Daniel’s unconventional methods, grounding the investigations in police procedure and offering a contrasting perspective.
