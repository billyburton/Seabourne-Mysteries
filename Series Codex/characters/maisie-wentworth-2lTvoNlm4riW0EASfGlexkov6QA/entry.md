Role: A local teenager who works part-time at Rosie’s Café and is often seen around town.

Background: Maisie is a bright, curious, and somewhat rebellious teenager who’s grown up in Seabourne. She’s close to finishing school and dreams of leaving Seabourne for the big city, though she’s not entirely sure what she wants to do with her life. Maisie is the daughter of one of Seabourne’s few single parents, and she often feels the weight of her family’s expectations on her shoulders. Despite her youthful impatience, Maisie has a good heart and is fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

Personality: Maisie is witty, sharp-tongued, and full of energy. She’s quick to speak her mind and isn’t afraid to challenge authority, though she’s respectful of those she truly admires. She’s tech-savvy and often helps others with their digital dilemmas, and she’s always on the lookout for new experiences. Maisie can be a bit of a gossip, but she’s careful not to spread anything that could truly harm someone.

Physical Description: Maisie is of medium height with a slim build, and she has shoulder-length, straight brown hair that she often dyes in streaks of bright colors. Her clothing style is a mix of casual and edgy—jeans, graphic tees, and sneakers, often paired with a leather jacket. Her expressive brown eyes are often lined with black eyeliner, giving her a slightly rebellious look.

Role in the Series: Maisie represents the younger generation of Seabourne, and her youthful perspective often brings fresh insights into the cases. She’s close to Chloe, seeing her as a mentor, and sometimes helps Daniel and Chloe with research, particularly when it involves technology. Maisie’s knowledge of the town’s teenage scene also provides useful intel that the adults might overlook.
