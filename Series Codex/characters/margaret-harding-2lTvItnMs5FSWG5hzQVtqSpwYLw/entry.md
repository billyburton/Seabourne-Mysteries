Role: The owner and caretaker of the independently owned home where Daniel and Chloe live.

Background: Margaret Harding, known to everyone as Mrs. Harding, has lived in Seabourne her entire life. A widow with no children of her own, she has dedicated her life to caring for those who need a little extra support. She started the home for neurodivergent individuals over a decade ago, seeing a need for a safe, supportive environment in her beloved town. Mrs. Harding is deeply compassionate, with a no-nonsense attitude and a warm heart. She’s a fixture in the community, known for her homemade jams and her ability to organize any event with military precision.

Personality: Mrs. Harding is both kind and firm, providing structure and stability to the residents of her home. She’s the type of person who can fix a leaking pipe one moment and provide a shoulder to cry on the next. Her sense of humor is dry, often catching people off guard, and she has a way of knowing exactly what’s going on in Seabourne, even before the rest of the town does.

Physical Description: A sturdy woman with a strong, capable build, Mrs. Harding has short, salt-and-pepper hair that she keeps neatly styled. She often wears practical, comfortable clothing—cardigans, slacks, and sturdy shoes—perfect for someone who’s always on the move. Her eyes are a sharp blue, with a twinkle that suggests she’s always one step ahead.

Role in the Series: Mrs. Harding is a motherly figure to Daniel and Chloe, offering them guidance and support. She also serves as a link to the wider community of Seabourne, often providing crucial information or connections that help solve the mysteries.

Twist: Mrs. Harding was once a covert operative for British intelligence during the Cold War. Her skills in observation, cryptography, and psychological analysis are why she’s so good at managing the home where Daniel lives. She’s lived a life of secrets, and while she’s officially “retired,” she still has connections and knows more about the shadowy side of the world than she lets on.

How It Adds Interest: This backstory gives her a reason to be exceptionally calm under pressure and provides a wealth of potential plot lines. Perhaps she occasionally uses her old skills to help Daniel in subtle ways, or maybe her past comes back to haunt her, drawing Daniel into a larger conspiracy.
