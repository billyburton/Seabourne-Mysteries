Role: The owner of the local bookshop, “Penny’s Pages.”

Background: Penny moved to Seabourne from Oxford, where she worked as a librarian for many years. She decided to open her own bookshop when she moved to Seabourne to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. Penny’s Pages has become a beloved spot in town, known for its cozy atmosphere and carefully curated selection of books. Penny is a passionate reader and has a particular love for mysteries and history. She’s unmarried and lives with her two cats, Agatha and Christie.

Personality: Penny is warm, intelligent, and a bit of an introvert, though she opens up around fellow book lovers. She’s meticulous in her work, ensuring her shop is always tidy and inviting. Penny has a quick wit and a dry sense of humor, and she enjoys matching people with the perfect book. Though she values her privacy, she’s always willing to help others, especially when it involves research or finding information. She’s a bit of a romantic, with a soft spot for love stories, though she’d never admit it.

Physical Description: Penny is petite and slightly round, with curly auburn hair that she usually wears pulled back with a headband. She has expressive hazel eyes and wears glasses that she’s constantly pushing up her nose. Penny’s clothing is comfortable and a bit whimsical—long skirts, patterned blouses, and cardigans in earthy tones. She always has a book or two in her bag, along with a notebook for jotting down ideas or interesting quotes.

Role in the Series: Penny serves as the intellectual heart of Seabourne, often helping Daniel and Chloe with research or finding obscure references in books. Her bookshop is also a place where characters come to relax and think, making it a key setting for important conversations and discoveries. Penny’s knowledge of literature and history often provides the key to solving the mysteries that Daniel and Chloe face.
