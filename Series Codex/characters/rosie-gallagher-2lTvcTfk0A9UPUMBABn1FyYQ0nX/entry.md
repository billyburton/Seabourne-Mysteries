Role: The owner of "Rosie’s Café," a popular meeting spot in the town center.

Background: Rosie moved to Seabourne from London five years ago, seeking a slower pace of life after burning out in the city’s corporate world. She bought the café on a whim and has since turned it into one of the town’s most beloved spots. Rosie’s Café is known for its homemade pastries, excellent coffee, and the warm, welcoming atmosphere Rosie herself creates. She’s single and content, though she’s been known to have a few admirers in town.

Personality: Rosie is lively, warm, and always ready with a smile or a cup of tea. She’s a natural people person, able to chat with anyone about anything, and she has a knack for making everyone feel at home. Beneath her cheerful exterior, however, Rosie is perceptive and has a sharp mind, often picking up on details others miss. She’s also fiercely loyal to her friends and will go out of her way to help someone in need.

Physical Description: Rosie is petite and curvy, with a cascade of auburn curls that she usually wears in a loose bun. She has bright green eyes and a ready smile. Rosie dresses in vintage-inspired clothing—floral dresses, cardigans, and aprons—and she always has a bit of flour on her from baking.

Role in the Series: Rosie serves as the social hub of Seabourne, where gossip and news flow freely. She often provides Daniel and Chloe with valuable information, whether it’s from overheard conversations in the café or her own observations. Rosie’s friendly demeanor makes her a trusted confidant for many in town, making her an indispensable ally in solving mysteries.
