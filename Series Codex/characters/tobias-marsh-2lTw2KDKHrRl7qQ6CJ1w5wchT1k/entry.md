Role: The town’s postman and amateur fisherman.

Background: Toby has lived in Seabourne all his life, following in his father’s footsteps as the town’s postman. He knows every nook and cranny of the town, as well as every resident’s habits and routines. In his free time, Toby enjoys fishing and can often be found at the harbor, either preparing his gear or chatting with the local fishermen. He’s unmarried, content with his quiet life, and takes great pride in his work.

Personality: Toby is easygoing, friendly, and reliable—qualities that make him a beloved figure in Seabourne. He’s always up for a chat and is known for his encyclopedic knowledge of local news and rumors. Despite his calm demeanor, Toby is deeply curious and enjoys solving puzzles, whether it’s figuring out where a letter got misdelivered or understanding why someone’s acting out of character. He’s a bit of a romantic at heart, often daydreaming about adventures he’s read about in books.

Physical Description: Toby is of average height and build, with short-cropped sandy hair and a perpetual five o’clock shadow. He dresses in the standard postman’s uniform—blue trousers, a button-up shirt, and a jacket—though he often swaps his cap for a fishing hat when he’s off-duty. Toby’s face is usually set in a relaxed smile, and his blue eyes have a twinkle that suggests he’s always thinking about something interesting.

Role in the Series: Toby is a valuable resource for information, given his extensive knowledge of the town’s daily goings-on. He often provides Daniel and Chloe with insights based on his observations during his postal rounds. His role as the town’s postman also allows him to deliver crucial clues—sometimes quite literally.
