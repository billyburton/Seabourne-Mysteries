Daniel lives in an independently owned home that provides a supportive environment for people who are neurodivergent. The home is located in a quiet area of Seabourne, not far from the Seabourne Craft Workshop. The house itself is a large, welcoming building with a well-tended garden where Chloe often spends time. The interior is designed to be both comfortable and calming, with spaces for both socializing and solitude, depending on the residents’ needs.
