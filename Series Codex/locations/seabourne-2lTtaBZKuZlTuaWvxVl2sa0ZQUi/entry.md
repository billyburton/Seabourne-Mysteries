Location and Setting: Seabourne is a picturesque small coastal town located on the rugged coastline of the United Kingdom. The town is nestled in a gentle curve of the coast, where the cliffs rise sharply from the sea, creating a dramatic backdrop against the ever-changing waters. A small, sandy beach lies at the foot of these cliffs, accessible by a winding path that descends from the town. The town's natural beauty is enhanced by the ever-present sound of waves crashing against the shore and the briny scent of the sea that permeates the air.

Town Layout: The town center is a charming cluster of narrow, cobblestone streets that wind their way up from the harbor. The streets are lined with an eclectic mix of old stone cottages, Victorian-era townhouses, and a few newer buildings that have been designed to blend seamlessly with Seabourneâ€™s historic character. At the heart of the town center is the market square, a lively hub of activity where locals gather to shop, socialize, and enjoy the seasonal events that Seabourne is known for.
