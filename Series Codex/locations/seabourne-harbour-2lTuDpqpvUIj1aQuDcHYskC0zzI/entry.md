The harbor is the beating heart of Seabourne, bustling with activity as colorful fishing boats and small yachts bob gently in the water. Weathered wooden piers extend out into the harbor, where locals often gather to buy fresh seafood from the stalls or simply to enjoy the view. The harbor is surrounded by quaint seafood restaurants, cafes, and small shops selling maritime-themed souvenirs.
