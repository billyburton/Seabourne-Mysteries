Perched on the cliffs at the edge of town, the Seabourne Lighthouse is a beloved local landmark. Its white and red stripes are visible from almost anywhere in the town, serving as both a beacon for sailors and a symbol of safety and guidance for the townsfolk. The lighthouse keeper's cottage, now a small museum, offers insights into Seabourneâ€™s maritime history.
