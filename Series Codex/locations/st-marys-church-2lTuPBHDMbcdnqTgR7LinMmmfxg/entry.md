Overlooking Seabourne from a hilltop, St. Mary’s Church is a small, stone-built church with a spire that can be seen from most parts of the town. The churchyard is dotted with ancient gravestones and wildflowers, providing a peaceful place for reflection. The church bells chime softly every hour, a sound that has become a comforting part of daily life in Seabourne.
