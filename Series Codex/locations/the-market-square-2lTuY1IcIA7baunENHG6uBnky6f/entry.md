The market square is the focal point of Seabourne’s town center. Surrounded by independent shops, including a bakery, a bookshop, a florist, and a general store, the square is always lively. It’s the site of many of the town’s seasonal events, from the Harvest Festival to the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. A centuries-old oak tree stands in the center of the square, symbolizing the town’s long history and strong community spirit.
