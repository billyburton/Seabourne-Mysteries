Located just outside the town along a winding country road, the Old Mill is a charming tearoom and bakery that was once a functional watermill. The millâ€™s wheel still turns gently in the stream beside it, and the surrounding gardens are a favorite spot for picnics and quiet contemplation. The Old Mill is famous for its scones and clotted cream, and its rustic charm makes it a popular destination for both locals and tourists.
