This converted boathouse near the harbor is now a bustling workshop where local artisans, including Daniel, practice their crafts. The workshop is filled with the scent of freshly cut wood and the sound of tools at work. Shelves are lined with beautifully crafted wooden items, pottery, and other handmade goods. The workshop is a place of creativity and community, where artisans share their skills and ideas.
