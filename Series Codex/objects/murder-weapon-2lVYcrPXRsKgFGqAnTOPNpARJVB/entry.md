Henry used his knowledge of chemistry (a hobby of his, picked up during his younger years) to create a potent, fast-acting poison. Knowing that Reggie would be drinking from a glass of water during the ceremony (a routine that Reggie followed to soothe his throat before making public speeches), Henry discreetly laced the glass with the poison.

To gain access to the glass, Henry exploited his connections with the event organizers. He volunteered to help set up the stage, using this opportunity to spike the water glass just before it was placed on the podium. Henry ensured that no one was watching when he did this, taking advantage of the bustling activity as the final preparations were made.
