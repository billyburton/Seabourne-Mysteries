2\. Incident Summary

On 21 November 2024, at approximately 7:00 PM, Mayor Reginald Pompington collapsed and died during the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Seabourne’s Market Square. The event was attended by a large portion of the town’s population, estimated at around 200 people. The Mayor was in the process of turning on the Christmas lights when he suddenly fell to the ground and became unresponsive. Emergency services were called immediately, but the Mayor was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

3\. Scene Description

Weather Conditions: Clear skies, light breeze, temperature approximately 4°C.

Location Details: Market Square is an open area in the center of Seabourne, surrounded by shops and the town’s historical oak tree. A temporary stage had been set up near the Christmas tree for the ceremony. The square was illuminated by streetlights and festive decorations at the time of the incident.

Condition of the Scene: The stage where Mayor Pompington collapsed was cordoned off by officers. The area around the stage was crowded with onlookers, many of whom were still present when officers arrived. The ground was paved, with no apparent signs of struggle or disturbance.

4\. Evidence Collected

Item 1: A crystal glass found near the Mayor’s podium, containing remnants of a clear liquid (presumed to be water). The glass was recovered by Officer Jenna Powell and placed in an evidence bag for further analysis.

Item 2: A partially burned Christmas tree light bulb, found near the foot of the Christmas tree. The significance is unclear but was collected for examination.

Item 3: Mayor Pompington’s personal effects, including his mobile phone, wallet, and a handwritten speech found in his suit pocket. These items were cataloged and secured.

Item 4: Video footage from a local resident’s smartphone, capturing the moment of the Mayor’s collapse. The footage was submitted to the Seabourne Police Department and stored as digital evidence.

5\. Initial Findings

Cause of Death: Pending autopsy results. Preliminary examination by paramedics indicated no visible wounds or external trauma.

Possible Poisoning: Given the sudden nature of the collapse and the absence of external injuries, poisoning is a suspected cause of death. The contents of the glass found at the scene have been sent to the forensic lab for toxicology testing.

No Immediate Signs of Struggle: The scene did not show evidence of a physical altercation. Witnesses reported the Mayor appeared healthy and in good spirits prior to the incident.

6\. Witness Statements

Witness 1: Margaret Pompington (Wife)

Statement: Mrs. Pompington was standing beside her husband when he collapsed. She reported that the Mayor had not complained of feeling unwell prior to the event and had been excited about the ceremony. Mrs. Pompington did not see anyone suspicious near the stage before or during the incident.

Witness 2: Rosie Gallagher (Owner of Rosie’s Café)

Statement: Ms. Gallagher was near the front of the crowd, approximately 10 feet from the stage. She observed Mayor Pompington take a sip from the crystal glass just before collapsing. Ms. Gallagher did not notice anything unusual about the Mayor’s behavior, though she mentioned that the Mayor had received a number of anonymous letters in the past few weeks, which he dismissed as harmless.

Witness 3: Maisie Wentworth (Local Teenager)

Statement: Maisie was recording the ceremony on her phone from a distance. She noted that the Mayor paused for a moment after taking a sip of water, as if he were about to cough, before he suddenly fell. Maisie mentioned that earlier in the evening, she saw a figure lingering near the Christmas tree, though she couldn’t identify who it was due to the crowd and the figure’s dark clothing.

Witness 4: Reverend Peter Merriweather

Statement: Reverend Merriweather was on the stage with the Mayor, preparing to give a blessing. He reported that the Mayor seemed perfectly fine, with no signs of distress until the moment he collapsed. The Reverend also confirmed that the Mayor was not under any known medical treatment and had not mentioned any health concerns.

7\. Actions Taken

Scene Secured: The Market Square was cleared of civilians and secured by officers. The stage area remains cordoned off pending further investigation.

Body Transported: Mayor Pompington’s body was transported to Seabourne General Hospital for a full autopsy.

Toxicology Requested: Samples of the liquid from the crystal glass have been sent to the forensic lab for analysis. Results are pending.

Search for Additional Evidence: Officers conducted a preliminary sweep of the area for any additional evidence, focusing on the stage and the vicinity of the Christmas tree. No additional items of immediate concern were found.

Interview Requests: Several key figures, including close colleagues of the Mayor and those involved in the planning of the event, have been requested to come in for formal interviews.

8\. Next Steps

Autopsy Results: Awaiting autopsy and toxicology reports to confirm the cause of death.

Further Interviews: Conduct detailed interviews with all event organizers, close associates of the Mayor, and anyone who might have had access to the stage area before the event.

Examination of Letters: Investigate the anonymous letters mentioned by Rosie Gallagher to determine if they contain any threats or clues.

Community Outreach: Request information from the public regarding any suspicious behavior observed before or during the event.

Report Conclusion: At this stage, the death of Mayor Reginald Pompington is classified as suspicious, with poisoning being a primary hypothesis pending further evidence. The investigation is ongoing, with all efforts focused on determining the exact circumstances surrounding the Mayor’s untimely death.
