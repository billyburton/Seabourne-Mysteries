\### \*\*Chloe Bennett: A Personal Introduction\*\*

Hi, I’m Chloe Bennett. I’m 22 years old, and I’ve been living in Seabourne for about two years now. Before I came here, life was… well, it wasn’t easy. I grew up in a big city, where everyone’s in a rush and no one really takes the time to understand you. I’ve always been a bit different, and that didn’t exactly fit in with the world I was born into. My brain gets overwhelmed sometimes—too many noises, too many people, too many things happening all at once. It can make me anxious, and it’s hard to explain to people why I need things to be a certain way. But here in Seabourne, things are quieter, slower. I can breathe here.

I live in a special home that’s designed for people like me—people who think and feel differently. It’s a place where we can be ourselves without judgment, and where we get the support we need to live our lives as independently as possible. Mrs. Harding runs the place, and she’s wonderful. She’s patient and kind, and she understands that we all have our own rhythms, our own ways of doing things. I share the home with a few others, but the person I’m closest to is Ethan. He’s my best friend, and I don’t know what I’d do without him.

\### \*\*Photography and Connection\*\*

One of my favorite things to do is photography. I always have my camera with me. There’s something about capturing a moment, a feeling, that I find really grounding. When I’m looking through the lens, everything else fades away, and it’s just me and whatever I’m focused on. Seabourne is full of beautiful, quiet moments—like the way the light reflects off the harbor at sunset, or the way the fog rolls in from the sea, making everything look like it’s part of a dream. I take pictures of those moments, but also of the people here. I like to capture their expressions, their emotions. You can learn a lot about someone by looking at their face in a quiet moment.

I think that’s why I’m good at understanding people. I notice the little things—the way someone’s shoulders tense when they’re upset, or the way their eyes light up when they’re happy. Emotions are like colors to me, vivid and clear. But I know that not everyone sees them that way, especially Ethan. He’s brilliant, and he sees things that no one else does, but he struggles with emotions and social cues. That’s where I come in.

\### \*\*Why I Help Ethan\*\*

Ethan is my best friend, and I help him because… well, because I care about him. But it’s more than that. Ethan has this incredible ability to see the world in ways that others can’t. He notices details that I wouldn’t even think to look for, and his logical mind can untangle the most complex problems. But when it comes to understanding people, reading their emotions, that’s where he struggles. And that’s where I can help. I can see what he can’t—the fear behind someone’s smile, the anger in their words even when they’re trying to hide it.

We balance each other out. He helps me stay grounded when my anxiety starts to get the best of me, and I help him navigate the tricky social waters. When he noticed something was off at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony—the way the mayor’s lips were a strange color—I knew we had to figure out what happened. He was frustrated because he couldn’t quite explain what he was seeing, but I could tell that he was onto something. So, we worked together, like we always do, and we uncovered the truth.

It’s not just about solving the puzzle for me, though that’s part of it. I help Ethan because I believe in him, because I know that together, we can make sense of things that might seem impossible to understand. And I think, deep down, he needs someone who believes in him, who sees his value even when he doubts himself. I’m that person for him, just like he’s the one who helps me feel safe and understood.

\### \*\*Family and Friends\*\*

My family is complicated. They love me, I know that, but they didn’t really know how to deal with my differences. In the city, I always felt like I was being squeezed into a mold that didn’t fit. I was anxious all the time, and I didn’t have the support I needed. Moving to Seabourne and into this home was the best thing that ever happened to me. It’s where I met Ethan, and it’s where I finally started to feel like I belonged somewhere.

Ethan is more than just a friend to me. He’s like family. We understand each other in ways that most people don’t. He knows when I need space, and I know when he’s struggling to find the right words. We don’t always need to talk to communicate; sometimes a look or a gesture is enough. There are others in the home too, and we all get along, but Ethan is the one I’m closest to.

\### \*\*Living in Seabourne\*\*

Seabourne is my sanctuary. It’s a small town where things don’t change too much, and that’s exactly how I like it. There’s something comforting about knowing what to expect—how the streets look in the morning light, the sound of the sea at night, the familiar faces in the market square. The people here are kind, and they’ve accepted me for who I am, which means the world to me.

Photography helps me connect with this place, and with the people in it. When I’m behind the camera, I feel like I’m part of something bigger, capturing moments that might otherwise be lost. And then there’s the garden at our home. It’s my little piece of paradise. Tending to the plants, watching them grow, gives me a sense of peace and accomplishment. It’s a place where I can think, where I can be myself without any pressure.

\### \*\*Why I Continue to Solve Mysteries\*\*

I help Ethan solve these mysteries because it feels right. We’ve both had times in our lives where we felt misunderstood or out of place. But in solving these puzzles, in bringing justice to those who need it, I feel like we’re doing something that matters. It’s our way of giving back to this town that’s given us so much. Plus, working with Ethan is… it’s special. We complement each other perfectly, and there’s something deeply satisfying about putting all the pieces together, about making sense of the chaos.

So, that’s me, Chloe Bennett. I’m still figuring out who I am and where I fit in the world, but with Ethan by my side, I feel like we can face anything. We might be different, but together, we’re strong. We help each other, and in doing that, we help others too. That’s what keeps me going, day after day.
