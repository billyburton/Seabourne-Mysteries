\### \*\*Daniel Turner: A Personal Introduction\*\*

Hello, I’m Daniel Turner. I’m 20 years old, and I live in the small coastal town of Seabourne. It’s a quiet place, mostly, with the sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs and the wind always smelling like salt and seaweed. I like it here because everything is familiar, and I know the patterns of the town—how the light falls on the harbor at different times of the day, or the way the cobblestones feel underfoot as I walk to the workshop. Patterns are important to me. They make sense when other things don’t.

I live in a home that’s set up for people like me, who are neurodivergent. There are a few of us here, each with our own quirks and challenges. Some people might say we’re different, but I think everyone is different in their own way. The home is run by Mrs. Harding, who’s kind but firm. She understands that I need my space and that sometimes I get frustrated when I can’t find the right words to say what I’m thinking. But she also knows that I’m good with my hands and my mind, and she encourages me to focus on what I’m good at.

\### \*\*Woodturning and Solving Puzzles\*\*

My favorite thing to do is woodturning. I spend hours in the Seabourne Craft Workshop, shaping wood into bowls, vases, and other things. There’s something about the way the wood feels as it spins on the lathe, how I can take something rough and shapeless and turn it into something smooth and purposeful. It’s like solving a puzzle, which is another thing I enjoy. Puzzles are all about finding patterns, making connections, and seeing the bigger picture, which is something that comes naturally to me.

It was this love for puzzles that got me involved in solving the first murder. It was during the town’s Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Everyone was happy, and the mayor was about to flip the switch to light up the tree when he suddenly collapsed. People thought it was just a terrible accident, maybe his heart gave out, but I noticed something others didn’t—a faint bluish tint on his lips. I knew right away that something was wrong. It reminded me of something I’d read about before—how certain poisons can cause that kind of reaction. I couldn’t just ignore it.

\### \*\*Why I Continue to Solve Murders\*\*

At first, I didn’t think of myself as someone who solves murders. I just saw something that didn’t fit, a piece of the puzzle that was out of place. But once I started looking, I couldn’t stop. It’s like the woodturning—once you start shaping something, you can’t leave it half-done. It needs to be finished, to be understood. And that’s what solving these mysteries is like for me. It’s about making sense of things that don’t make sense, finding the truth hidden beneath the surface. And there’s satisfaction in that, in knowing that I can do something that helps people, even if it’s in my own quiet way.

Plus, I have Chloe. She’s my best friend, and she lives in the same home as I do. Chloe is different too, but in a way that complements me. Where I see patterns and logic, she sees emotions and motivations. She understands people in a way that I struggle with, and she helps me navigate the parts of life that are more complicated than just solving a puzzle. We make a good team. She helps me talk to people when I don’t know what to say, and I help her see the details she might miss. Together, we’re more than we are apart.

\### \*\*Family and Friends\*\*

My family… well, it’s complicated. My parents love me, I know that. But they didn’t always understand me. They tried, but they didn’t know how to handle the way my brain works, how I can get lost in details or frustrated when things don’t make sense. When I was younger, I think they worried a lot about my future, about whether I’d be okay on my own. That’s why they agreed that I should move into this home, where there’s support if I need it but also independence. We still talk, and they visit, but it’s better this way. They see that I’m doing something important here, that I’m finding my place.

As for friends, Chloe is the best one I’ve ever had. We understand each other in a way that most people don’t. There are others in the home too, and we get along, but it’s different. With Chloe, I don’t have to explain myself. She just gets it. And that’s something I never thought I’d find—a friend who sees me for who I am, not just the parts of me that are difficult.

\### \*\*Living in Seabourne\*\*

Living in Seabourne feels right. It’s a small town, so you get to know everyone, and they get to know you. There are routines here that I find comforting—how Mrs. Harding always has tea ready at 4 PM, or how Mr. Harrison at the workshop always greets me the same way every morning. There’s a sense of order in Seabourne, but also mystery. The sea is always changing, and sometimes the fog rolls in so thick you can barely see your hand in front of your face. It’s like the town has its own secrets, waiting to be uncovered.

That’s what keeps me going. The mysteries, the puzzles, the feeling that I can make a difference, even if it’s just by noticing the little things that others don’t. And with Chloe by my side, I know I’m not alone in this. Together, we can bring clarity to the confusion, light to the darkness, and maybe even a little bit of peace to the people who need it most.

So that’s me, Daniel Turner. I’m not like everyone else, but that’s okay. I have my own way of seeing the world, and in Seabourne, that makes all the difference.
