Isabel “Izzy” Carmichael is a suspect in the murder because Mayor Pompington’s secret plans to bring a luxury resort to Seabourne have the potential to revitalize the town’s economy, but Izzy sees it as a threat. She fears the influx of wealthy tourists will drive up property prices and push out small businesses like hers. Additionally, she’s aware that the Mayor intended to replace the town’s quaint charm with something more commercial, which would directly impact her business and the community’s character.

Tobias “Toby” Marsh - The Postman is a suspect because Toby has a grudge against the Mayor because of a past dispute involving a piece of land Toby’s family once owned. The Mayor’s plans for development would have cut through this land, which is now part of a public park. Toby’s family was forced to sell the land years ago under what Toby believes were unfair terms, and he blames the Mayor for never righting that wrong.
