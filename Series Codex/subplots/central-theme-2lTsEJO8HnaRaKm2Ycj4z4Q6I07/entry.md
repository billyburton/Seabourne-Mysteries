"Embracing Identity and Finding Strength in Difference"

The central theme that ties the 10 books in The Seabourne Mysteries series together is "Embracing Identity and Finding Strength in Difference." Throughout the series, both Daniel and Chloe grapple with their neurodivergence and the ways in which it shapes their lives, relationships, and roles in the community. This theme evolves and deepens across the books as they come to understand, accept, and ultimately embrace their unique identities, finding strength in their differences rather than seeing them as weaknesses.
