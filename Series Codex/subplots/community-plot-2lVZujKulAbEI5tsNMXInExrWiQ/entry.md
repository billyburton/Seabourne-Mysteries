Seabourne is a town that prides itself on its history, close-knit community, and picturesque coastal charm. Many of the town’s residents have deep roots here, with families that have lived in Seabourne for generations. This connection to the past is reflected in the town’s architecture, its annual traditions, and the slower pace of life that most residents cherish.

However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern about Seabourne’s economic future. Some of the younger generation and newer residents argue that the town needs to modernize to survive. They believe that Seabourne should embrace new opportunities, such as tourism and development, to ensure its prosperity. This group sees the potential for growth in projects like the luxury resort that Mayor Reggie Pompington secretly supported—a project that, unbeknownst to many, would have brought significant change to the town.

On the other side are the traditionalists, who fear that such developments will destroy the very essence of what makes Seabourne special. They are deeply protective of the town’s character and are suspicious of any changes that might disrupt their way of life. This group includes older residents, like George “Georgie” Harrison, who have seen the town evolve slowly over the years and worry that modernization will erase its soul.
