**How It Adds Intrigue:**

This subplot introduces a rich vein of tension that runs beneath the surface of everyday life in Seabourne. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the issue of modernization is more divisive than it initially appears. The community is split between those who want to preserve the status quo and those who see change as a necessary evil.

Reggie Pompington’s death throws this issue into sharp relief, as it’s revealed that he was quietly pushing for the resort development, believing it to be the best way to secure Seabourne’s future. The fact that he kept this plan hidden only adds to the intrigue, as it suggests that Reggie knew how controversial it would be. The discovery of his intentions after his death creates a ripple effect, with residents questioning who else might have supported the project and what other secrets might be hidden within their seemingly idyllic town.

**Interest Through Characters and Their Perspectives:**

The subplot provides a backdrop for character development and interactions, as different residents take sides in the debate. Characters like Isabel “Izzy” Carmichael, who owns the Seabourne Florist, might feel conflicted—on one hand, she relies on local customers, but on the other, she recognizes the potential benefits of increased tourism for her business.

Meanwhile, younger characters like Maisie Wentworth might be more open to change, seeing it as an opportunity to bring new life to the town, while older characters like George “Georgie” Harrison are staunchly against it, fearing it will erase the town’s history and character. This generational divide adds another layer of conflict, as tradition clashes with the desire for progress.

**Conflict and Consequences:**

The community’s split creates a fertile ground for conflict, both open and hidden. There are heated town meetings, whispered conversations, and perhaps even acts of subtle sabotage as the debate intensifies. This tension also provides motive for various characters who might feel threatened by the proposed changes or betrayed by those who support them.

For example, Henry Davenport’s opposition to the resort is driven not just by his personal vendetta against Reggie but also by a genuine belief that the development would ruin Seabourne. His actions, however, take this opposition to a deadly extreme, reflecting how deeply these issues resonate within the community.

The subplot also allows for smaller, more personal conflicts to play out against the larger backdrop. Friendships are tested, alliances shift, and secrets come to light as characters navigate the changing landscape of their town. The tension between tradition and modernization becomes a mirror for the characters’ own struggles, making the mystery of Reggie’s death not just a whodunit but a story about the future of Seabourne itself.
