Plot: During the town’s annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony, the mayor collapses and dies after sipping mulled wine from a communal cup. The sleuth notices a small but important detail: the mayor’s lips had a faint bluish tint.

Killer: The mayor’s deputy, who has been eager to take over his position.

Plot Twist: The deputy didn’t poison the wine directly; instead, he tampered with the cup by lacing it with a slow-acting poison days before, knowing the mayor would be the first to drink from it.
