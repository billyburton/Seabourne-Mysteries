**Plot twists**

As the investigation unfolds, Daniel and Chloe uncover the letters mentioned by Rosie Gallagher, revealing that Henry had been sending anonymous notes to Reggie, subtly threatening him over the course of several months. However, these letters were carefully worded to avoid direct threats, making it difficult to tie them to Henry initially.

Daniel’s keen observation skills lead him to notice that the glass Reggie drank from had an unusual residue—a clue that eventually points to poisoning. Chloe’s ability to read people helps them identify Henry’s simmering resentment during their interactions with him, as well as his increasingly erratic behavior as the investigation closes in on him.

The final piece of evidence comes from Maisie Wentworth’s video footage, where a shadowy figure (later identified as Henry) can be seen near the podium just before the ceremony, placing the glass on the stand. When confronted with this evidence, Henry tries to deflect suspicion but ultimately breaks down and confesses, consumed by the weight of his guilt and frustration.

**Conclusion**

Henry Davenport is arrested and charged with the murder of Mayor Reginald Pompington. His actions, driven by envy and a misguided sense of justice, shocked the town of Seabourne, a place where such a violent act was unthinkable. The resolution of the case brings a mix of relief and sadness to the community, as they come to terms with the loss of their mayor and the revelation that one of their own was capable of such a crime. Daniel and Chloe’s success in solving the mystery further solidifies their roles as the town’s unlikely but highly effective detectives.
