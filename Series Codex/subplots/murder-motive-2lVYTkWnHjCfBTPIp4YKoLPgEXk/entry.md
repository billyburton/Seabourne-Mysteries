Henry’s motivation for murder stems from a combination of envy, resentment, and a desire to reclaim what he believes was rightfully his. He felt humiliated by his loss to Reggie and became increasingly bitter as Reggie’s popularity continued to grow. In Henry's mind, Reggie was more concerned with appearances and charm than with the practical needs of Seabourne, and he believed the town would be better off under his own leadership.

Henry's resentment deepened when he learned that Reggie was planning to announce a new initiative at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony—an initiative that would have greatly increased Reggie’s already significant popularity, further diminishing any chance Henry had of challenging him in the next election. This was the tipping point that led Henry to concoct a plan to eliminate his rival.
